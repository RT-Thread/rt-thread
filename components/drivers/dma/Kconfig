      Enable the DMA framework so DM-aware SoC drivers can request DMA channels,
      submit descriptors, and share controller instances that are described in
      the device tree. This pulls in the generic DMA core (`dma.c`) and the pool
      allocator used by slave/peripheral clients. Select it whenever your board
      has DMA-capable peripherals (MMC, SPI, audio, etc.) that need offloading;
      leave it disabled only on targets without DMA hardware to save code size.
