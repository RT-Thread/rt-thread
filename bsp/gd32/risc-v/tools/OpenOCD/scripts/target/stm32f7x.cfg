# On the STM32F7, the Flash is mapped at address 0x08000000 via the AXI and
# also address 0x00200000 via the ITCM. The former mapping is read-write in
# hardware, while the latter is read-only. By presenting an alias, we
# accomplish two things:
# (1) We allow writing at 0x00200000 (because the alias acts identically to the
#     original bank), which allows code intended to run from that address to
#     also be linked for loading at that address, simplifying linking.
# (2) We allow the proper memory map to be delivered to GDB, which will cause
#     it to use hardware breakpoints at the 0x00200000 mapping (correctly
#     identifying it as Flash), which it would otherwise not do. Configuring
#     the Flash via ITCM alias as virtual
