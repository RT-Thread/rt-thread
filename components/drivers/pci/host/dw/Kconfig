    help
      Enable support for Synopsys DesignWare PCIe controllers that appear in
      many SoCs. This pulls in common init logic that handles PHY resets, ATU
      windows, and DMA operations shared between host and endpoint modes.

    bool
    depends on RT_PCI_DW
    help
      Build the host-mode glue so the DesignWare IP enumerates downstream PCIe
      devices. Usually selected by SoC-specific configs targeting host mode.

config RT_PCI_DW_EP
    bool
    depends on RT_PCI_DW
    help
      Build the endpoint-mode glue so the DesignWare controller can act as a PCIe
      endpoint exposing its own BARs to a host.
