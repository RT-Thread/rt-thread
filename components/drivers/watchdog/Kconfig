    help
      Enable the common watchdog device layer so watchdog-capable SoCs or
      external supervisors can be exposed through the RT-Thread `rt_watchdog`
      APIs. Selecting this option allows watchdog platform drivers to register
      /dev/wdt style devices, lets applications query/set timeout windows, and
      integrates watchdog notifications into the driver-model (DM) probe/remove
      flow. Disable it only when the hardware has no watchdog or it is managed
      entirely outside of RT-Thread, because the system will no longer be able
      to arm, feed or inspect watchdogs during boot and runtime.

      Build the driver for Synopsys DesignWare watchdog blocks that appear in
      many ARM and RISC-V SoCs. The driver maps the DM platform resources,
      exports the 16 preset timeout levels ("TOPs"), supports optional pre-
      timeout interrupts, and automatically toggles the associated reset line
      through `RT_USING_RESET`. Once started the DW watchdog cannot be disabled,
      so the driver only gates the peripheral clock and pulses the reset
      controller to keep it under control. Use this when your device tree
      exposes a `snps,dw-wdt` node and you need either reset-based system
      recovery or two-stage IRQ/Reset supervision; otherwise leave it off.

    help
      Enable support for the watchdog integrated in Intel 6300ESB southbridge
      chipsets. The driver binds to the PCI device, unlocks the dual-stage timer,
      and exposes the 1 kHz heartbeat window (1–2046 seconds) through the
      standard watchdog IOCTLs. It can optionally enter "nowayout" mode when the
      firmware locks the control register, so be careful when testing on shared
      x86 hardware. Select this only on boards that actually contain the 6300ESB
      watchdog because the driver directly touches PCI config space and assumes
      the LPC reset registers are routed correctly.
