# Introduction to PWM

PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is a method of digitally encoding the level of an analog signal. The frequency of the square wave is used to encode the level of a specific analog signal by pulses of different frequencies. The output receives a series of pulses of equal magnitude and uses these pulses to replace the device with the desired waveform.

![PWM Schematic Diagram](figures/pwm-f.png)

Above is a simple schematic diagram of PWM. Assuming that the timer works in a up-counter mode. When the count value is less than the threshold, it outputs a level state, such as a high level. When the count value is greater than the threshold, it outputs the opposite, such as a low level.  When the count value reaches the maximum value, the counter recounts from 0 and returns to the original level state. The ratio of the high-level duration (pulse width) to the cycle time is the duty cycle, ranging from 0 to 100%. The high level of the above picture is just half of the cycle time, so the duty cycle is 50%.

One of the common PWM control scenarios is to adjust the brightness of a light or screen. The brightness can be adjusted through changing the duty cycle. The PWM does not adjust the light continuously, rather it constantly turns the screen on and off. When the light is turned on and off fast enough, the naked eye will always think that it is always bright. In the process of switching it on and off, the longer the light is off, the lower the brightness of the screen to the naked eye. Conversely, the longer the light is on, the brighter the screen will appear.

# Access to PWM Devices

The application accesses the PWM device hardware through the PWM device management interface provided by RT-Thread. The related interfaces are as follows:

| **Function** | Description   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| rt_device_find()  | Find device handles based on the name of PWM device |
| rt_pwm_set()     | Set PWM period and pulse width |
| rt_pwm_enable()   | Enable PWM device |
| rt_pwm_disable()  | Disable the PWM device |

## Find the PWM Device

The application obtains the device handle based on the name of PWM device, which in turn can operate the PWM device. The function is as follows:

```c
rt_device_t rt_device_find(const char* name);
```

| Parameter | Description                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| name     | Device             |
| **Return** | ——                                 |
| Device handle | Found the corresponding device, will return the corresponding device handle |
| RT_NULL  | Device not found |

In general, the name of the PWM device registered to the system is pwm0, pwm1, etc. The usage examples are as follows:

```c
#define PWM_DEV_NAME        "pwm3"  /* name of PWM device */
struct rt_device_pwm *pwm_dev;      /* PWM device handle */
/* Search the device */
pwm_dev = (struct rt_device_pwm *)rt_device_find(PWM_DEV_NAME);
```

## Set PWM Period and Pulse Width

Set the PWM period and duty cycle by using the following function:

```c
rt_err_t rt_pwm_set(struct rt_device_pwm *device,
                    int channel,
                    rt_uint32_t period,
                    rt_uint32_t pulse);
```

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| device     |  PWM device handle  |
| channel    | PWM channel      |
| period     | PWM period (ns) |
| pulse     | PWM pulse width time (ns) |
| **Return** | ——                |
| RT_EOK     | successful |
| -RT_EIO | device is null |
| -RT_ENOSYS | Device operation method is null |
| Other Errors | Execute failed |

The output frequency of the PWM is determined by the period. For example, the time of a period is 0.5ms (milliseconds), the period value is 500000ns (nanoseconds), the output frequency is 2KHz, the duty cycle is `pulse / period`, and the pulse value cannot exceed period.

An example of use is as follows:

```c
#define PWM_DEV_NAME        "pwm3"  /* name of PWM device */
#define PWM_DEV_CHANNEL      4      /* PWM channel */
struct rt_device_pwm *pwm_dev;      /* PWM device handle */
rt_uint32_t period, pulse;

period = 500000;    /* The period is 0.5ms, the unit is nanoseconds */
pulse = 0;          /* PWM pulse width value, the unit is nanoseconds */
/* Search the device */
pwm_dev = (struct rt_device_pwm *)rt_device_find(PWM_DEV_NAME);
/* Set the PWM period and pulse width */
rt_pwm_set(pwm_dev, PWM_DEV_CHANNEL, period, pulse);
```

## Enable the PWM Device

After setting the PWM period and pulse width, you can enable the PWM device by the following function:

```c
rt_err_t rt_pwm_enable(struct rt_device_pwm *device, int channel);
```

| Parameter | Description            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| device  | PWM device handle            |
| channel | PWM channel         |
| **Return** | ——                             |
| RT_EOK     | Enable device successful |
| -RT_ENOSYS | Device operation method is null |
| Other Errors | Enable device failed |

An example of use is as follows:

```c
#define PWM_DEV_NAME        "pwm3"  /* name of PWM device */
#define PWM_DEV_CHANNEL      4      /* PWM channel */
struct rt_device_pwm *pwm_dev;      /* PWM device handle */
rt_uint32_t period, pulse;

period = 500000;    /* The period is 0.5ms, the unit is nanoseconds */
pulse = 0;          /* PWM pulse width value, the unit is nanoseconds */
/* Search the device */
pwm_dev = (struct rt_device_pwm *)rt_device_find(PWM_DEV_NAME);
/* Set the PWM period and pulse width */
rt_pwm_set(pwm_dev, PWM_DEV_CHANNEL, period, pulse);
/* Enable the device */
rt_pwm_enable(pwm_dev, PWM_DEV_CHANNEL);
```

## Disable the PWM device Channel

Use the following function to turn off the corresponding channel of the PWM device.

```c
rt_err_t rt_pwm_disable(struct rt_device_pwm *device, int channel);
```

| **Parameter** | Description   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| device  | PWM device handle               |
| channel | PWM channel    |
| **Return** | ——                             |
| RT_EOK     | Turn off device successful |
| -RT_EIO | Device handle is null |
| Other Errors | Turn off device failed |

An example of use is as follows:

```c
#define PWM_DEV_NAME        "pwm3"  /* name of PWM device */
#define PWM_DEV_CHANNEL      4      /* PWM channel */
struct rt_device_pwm *pwm_dev;      /* PWM device handle */
rt_uint32_t period, pulse;

period = 500000;    /* The period is 0.5ms, the unit is nanoseconds */
pulse = 0;          /* PWM pulse width value, the unit is nanoseconds */
/* Search the device */
pwm_dev = (struct rt_device_pwm *)rt_device_find(PWM_DEV_NAME);
/* Set the PWM period and pulse width */
rt_pwm_set(pwm_dev, PWM_DEV_CHANNEL, period, pulse);
/* Enable the device */
rt_pwm_enable(pwm_dev, PWM_DEV_CHANNEL);
/* Turn off the device channel */
rt_pwm_disable(pwm_dev,PWM_DEV_CHANNEL);
```
