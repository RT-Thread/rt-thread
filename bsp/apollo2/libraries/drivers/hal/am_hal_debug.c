//! @param pcFile is the name of the source file where the error occurred.
//! @param ui32Line is the line number where the error occurred.
//! @param pcMessage is an optional message describing the failure.
//!
//! This function is called by am_hal_debug_assert() macro when the supplied
//! condition is not true. The implementation here simply halts the application
//! for further analysis. Individual applications may define their own
//! implementations of am_hal_debug_error() to provide more detailed feedback
//! about the failed am_hal_debug_assert() statement.
