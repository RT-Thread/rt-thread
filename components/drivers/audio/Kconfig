    help
      Enable the RT-Thread audio framework so playback/record devices may be
      registered, DMA pipes allocated, and ALSA-like controls exposed via
      `rt_audio_*` APIs. Choose this whenever your board has I2S/TDM codecs or
      PDM microphones; disable it on MCU builds that do not process audio data.

              Size in bytes for each block inside the replay memory pool used by
              `dev_audio.c` to stage PCM data before pushing it to DMA. Larger
              values increase latency but reduce IRQ pressure; shrink it when
              RAM is tight and the codec tolerates smaller bursts.

            int "Replay memory pool block count"
            default 2
            help
              Number of replay memory pool blocks. Raising this allows more
              outstanding audio buffers (useful for long DMA transfers) but
              consumes additional RAM = `BLOCK_SIZE * COUNT`.

            int "Record pipe size"
            default 2048
            help
              Size of the ring buffer used to capture samples before user-space
              reads them. Increase this to prevent overflow when the recorder
              callback runs slower than the DMA completion interrupt; reduce it
              on memory constrained platforms.
