menuconfig RT_USING_CPLUSPLUS
    bool "Enable C++ features"
    default n
    help
        RT_USING_CPLUSPLUS is the master switch for enabling C++ support.

        It is off by default. Once enabled, RT-Thread's build system ensures that a C++ compiler is used to compile .cpp files,
        and it links C++ standard libraries (such as libstdc++ or libc++) into the final firmware.
        Other C++-related configuration items that depend on it become visible and configurable.

        help
            RT_USING_CPLUSPLUS11 controls whether support for multithreading features in the C++11 standard is enabled.

            It is disabled by default. Once enabled, RT_USING_POSIX_FS, RT_USING_POSIX_STDIO, RT_USING_PTHREADS, and RT_USING_RTC will also be enabled.

        help
            RT_USING_CPP_WRAPPER is used to enable the C++ wrapper for the RT-Thread core API.

            When this option is enabled(Off by default), RT-Thread provides an additional set of C++ code that encapsulates the underlying C API using classes and objects.
    config RT_USING_CPP_EXCEPTIONS
        bool "Enable C++ exceptions (will increase overhead)"
        default n
        help
            RT_USING_CPP_EXCEPTIONS is used to enable C++ exception handling.
