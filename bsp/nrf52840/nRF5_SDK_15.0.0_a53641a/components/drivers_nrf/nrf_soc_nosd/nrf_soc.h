/**@brief Waits for an application event.
 *
 * An application event is either an application interrupt or a pended interrupt when the
 * interrupt is disabled. When the interrupt is enabled it will be taken immediately since
 * this function will wait in thread mode, then the execution will return in the application's
 * main thread. When an interrupt is disabled and gets pended it will return to the application's
 * thread main. The application must ensure that the pended flag is cleared using
 * ::sd_nvic_ClearPendingIRQ in order to sleep using this function. This is only necessary for
 * disabled interrupts, as the interrupt handler will clear the pending flag automatically for
 * enabled interrupts.
 *
 * In order to wake up from disabled interrupts, the SEVONPEND flag has to be set in the Cortex-M0
 * System Control Register (SCR). @sa CMSIS_SCB
 *
 * @note If an application interrupt has happened since the last time sd_app_evt_wait was
 *       called this function will return immediately and not go to sleep. This is to avoid race
 *       conditions that can occur when a flag is updated in the interrupt handler and processed
 *       in the main loop.
 *
 * @post An application interrupt has happened or a interrupt pending flag is set.
 *
 * @retval ::NRF_SUCCESS
