 * @brief ADC_SC1 - ADC Status and Control Registers 1 (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x0000001FU
 *
 * SC1A is used for both software and hardware trigger modes of operation. To
 * allow sequential conversions of the ADC to be triggered by internal peripherals,
 * the ADC can have more than one status and control register: one for each
 * conversion. The SC1B-SC1n registers indicate potentially multiple SC1 registers
 * for use only in hardware trigger mode. See the chip configuration information
 * about the number of SC1n registers specific to this device. The SC1n registers
 * have identical fields, and are used in a "ping-pong" approach to control ADC
 * operation. At any one point in time, only one of the SC1n registers is actively
 * controlling ADC conversions. Updating SC1A while SC1n is actively controlling
 * a conversion is allowed, and vice-versa for any of the SC1n registers specific
 * to this MCU. Writing SC1A while SC1A is actively controlling a conversion
 * aborts the current conversion. In Software Trigger mode, when SC2[ADTRG]=0,
 * writes to SC1A subsequently initiate a new conversion, if SC1[ADCH] contains a
 * value other than all 1s (module disabled). Writing any of the SC1n registers while
 * that specific SC1n register is actively controlling a conversion aborts the
 * current conversion. None of the SC1B-SC1n registers are used for software
 * trigger operation and therefore writes to the SC1B-SC1n registers do not initiate a
 * new conversion.

 *
 * Selects one of the input channels. The input channel decode depends on the
 * value of DIFF. DAD0-DAD3 are associated with the input pin pairs DADPx and
 * DADMx. Some of the input channel options in the bitfield-setting descriptions might
 * not be available for your device. For the actual ADC channel assignments for
 * your device, see the Chip Configuration details. The successive approximation
 * converter subsystem is turned off when the channel select bits are all set,
 * that is, ADCH = 11111. This feature allows explicit disabling of the ADC and
 * isolation of the input channel from all sources. Terminating continuous
 * conversions this way prevents an additional single conversion from being performed. It
 * is not necessary to set ADCH to all 1s to place the ADC in a low-power state
 * when continuous conversions are not enabled because the module automatically
 * enters a low-power state when a conversion completes.

 * Each PACR register consists of eight 4-bit PACR fields. Each PACR field
 * defines the access levels for a particular peripheral. The mapping between a
 * peripheral and its PACR field is shown in the table below. The peripheral assignment
 * to each PACR is defined by the memory map slot that the peripheral is
 * assigned to. See this chip's memory map for the assignment of a particular
 * peripheral. The following table shows the location of each peripheral slot's PACR field
 * in the PACR registers. Offset Register [31:28] [27:24] [23:20] [19:16] [15:12]

 * @brief AXBS_PRS - Priority Registers Slave (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00043210U
 *
 * The priority registers (PRSn) set the priority of each master port on a per
 * slave port basis and reside in each slave port. The priority register can be
 * accessed only with 32-bit accesses. After the CRSn[RO] bit is set, the PRSn
 * register can only be read; attempts to write to it have no effect on PRSn and
 * result in a bus-error response to the master initiating the write. Two available
 * masters must not be programmed with the same priority level. Attempts to
 * program two or more masters with the same priority level result in a bus-error
 * response and the PRSn is not updated. Valid values for the Mn priority fields
 * depend on which masters are available on the chip. This information can be found in
 * the chip-specific information for the crossbar. If the chip contains less
 * than five masters, values 0 to 3 are valid. Writing other values will result in
 * an error. If the chip contains five or more masters, valid values are 0 to n-1,
 * where n is the number of masters attached to the Crossbar Switch. Other
 * values will result in an error. See the chip-specific crossbar information for the
 * reset value of this register.

/*!
 * @brief DMA_CR - Control Register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000400U
 *
 * The CR defines the basic operating configuration of the DMA. The DMA
 * arbitrates channel service requests in two groups of 16 channels each: Group 1
 * contains channels 31-16 Group 0 contains channels 15-0 Arbitration within a group can
 * be configured to use either a fixed-priority or a round-robin scheme. For
 * fixed-priority arbitration, the highest priority channel requesting service is
 * selected to execute. The channel priority registers assign the priorities; see
 * the DCHPRIn registers. For round-robin arbitration, the channel priorities are
 * ignored and channels within each group are cycled through (from high to low
 * channel number) without regard to priority. For correct operation, writes to the
 * CR register must be performed only when the DMA channels are inactive; that
 * is, when TCDn_CSR[ACTIVE] bits are cleared. The group priorities operate in a
 * similar fashion. In group fixed priority arbitration mode, channel service
 * requests in the highest priority group are executed first, where priority level 1
 * is the highest and priority level 0 is the lowest. The group priorities are
 * assigned in the GRPnPRI fields of the DMA Control Register (CR). All group
 * priorities must have unique values prior to any channel service requests occurring;
 * otherwise, a configuration error will be reported. For group round robin
 * arbitration, the group priorities are ignored and the groups are cycled through
 * (from high to low group number) without regard to priority. Minor loop offsets
 * are address offset values added to the final source address (TCDn_SADDR) or
 * destination address (TCDn_DADDR) upon minor loop completion. When minor loop
 * offsets are enabled, the minor loop offset (MLOFF) is added to the final source
 * address (TCDn_SADDR), to the final destination address (TCDn_DADDR), or to both
 * prior to the addresses being written back into the TCD. If the major loop is
 * complete, the minor loop offset is ignored and the major loop address offsets
 * (TCDn_SLAST and TCDn_DLAST_SGA) are used to compute the next TCDn_SADDR and
 * TCDn_DADDR values. When minor loop mapping is enabled (EMLM is 1), TCDn word2 is
 * redefined. A portion of TCDn word2 is used to specify multiple fields: a
 * source enable bit (SMLOE) to specify the minor loop offset should be applied to the

 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The EEI register provides a bit map for the 32 channels to enable the error
 * interrupt signal for each channel. The state of any given channel's error
 * interrupt enable is directly affected by writes to this register; it is also
 * affected by writes to the SEEI and CEEI. These registers are provided so that the
 * error interrupt enable for a single channel can easily be modified without the
 * need to perform a read-modify-write sequence to the EEI register. The DMA error
 * indicator and the error interrupt enable flag must be asserted before an
 * error interrupt request for a given channel is asserted to the interrupt
 * controller.

/*!
 * @brief DMA_INT - Interrupt Request Register (W1C)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The INT register provides a bit map for the 32 channels signaling the
 * presence of an interrupt request for each channel. Depending on the appropriate bit
 * setting in the transfer-control descriptors, the eDMA engine generates an
 * interrupt on data transfer completion. The outputs of this register are directly
 * routed to the interrupt controller. During the interrupt-service routine
 * associated with any given channel, it is the software's responsibility to clear the
 * appropriate bit, negating the interrupt request. Typically, a write to the CINT
 * register in the interrupt service routine is used for this purpose. The state
 * of any given channel's interrupt request is directly affected by writes to
 * this register; it is also affected by writes to the CINT register. On writes to
 * INT, a 1 in any bit position clears the corresponding channel's interrupt
 * request. A zero in any bit position has no affect on the corresponding channel's
 * current interrupt status. The CINT register is provided so the interrupt
 * request for a single channel can easily be cleared without the need to perform a
 * read-modify-write sequence to the INT register.

 * DMA_ERR - Error Register
 ******************************************************************************/

/*!
 * @brief DMA_ERR - Error Register (W1C)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The ERR provides a bit map for the 32 channels, signaling the presence of an
 * error for each channel. The eDMA engine signals the occurrence of an error
 * condition by setting the appropriate bit in this register. The outputs of this
 * register are enabled by the contents of the EEI, then logically summed across
 * groups of 16 and 32 channels to form several group error interrupt requests,
 * which are then routed to the interrupt controller. During the execution of the
 * interrupt-service routine associated with any DMA errors, it is software's
 * responsibility to clear the appropriate bit, negating the error-interrupt request.
 * Typically, a write to the CERR in the interrupt-service routine is used for
 * this purpose. The normal DMA channel completion indicators (setting the transfer
 * control descriptor DONE flag and the possible assertion of an interrupt
 * request) are not affected when an error is detected. The contents of this register
 * can also be polled because a non-zero value indicates the presence of a
 * channel error regardless of the state of the EEI. The state of any given channel's
 * error indicators is affected by writes to this register; it is also affected by
 * writes to the CERR. On writes to the ERR, a one in any bit position clears
 * the corresponding channel's error status. A zero in any bit position has no
 * affect on the corresponding channel's current error status. The CERR is provided
 * so the error indicator for a single channel can easily be cleared.

 * @brief FTM_SYNC - Synchronization (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * This register configures the PWM synchronization. A synchronization event can
 * perform the synchronized update of MOD, CV, and OUTMASK registers with the
 * value of their write buffer and the FTM counter initialization. The software
 * trigger, SWSYNC bit, and hardware triggers TRIG0, TRIG1, and TRIG2 bits have a
 * potential conflict if used together when SYNCMODE = 0. Use only hardware or
 * software triggers but not both at the same time, otherwise unpredictable behavior
 * is likely to happen. The selection of the loading point, CNTMAX and CNTMIN
 * bits, is intended to provide the update of MOD, CNTIN, and CnV registers across
 * all enabled channels simultaneously. The use of the loading point selection
 * together with SYNCMODE = 0 and hardware trigger selection, TRIG0, TRIG1, or TRIG2
 * bits, is likely to result in unpredictable behavior. The synchronization
 * event selection also depends on the PWMSYNC (MODE register) and SYNCMODE (SYNCONF
 * register) bits. See PWM synchronization.

 * to 1. A transfer begins. The MCU signals the I2C module to enter stop mode. The
 * byte currently being transferred, including both address and data, completes
 * its transfer. The I2C slave or master acknowledges that the in-transfer byte
 * completed its transfer and acknowledges the request to enter stop mode. After
 * receiving the I2C module's acknowledgment of the request to enter stop mode,
 * the MCU determines whether to shut off the I2C module's clock. If the SHEN bit
 * is set to 1 and the I2C module is in an idle or disabled state when the MCU
 * signals to enter stop mode, the module immediately acknowledges the request to
 * enter stop mode. If SHEN is cleared to 0 and the overall data transmission or

 * When this field is set and using an internally generated bit clock in either

 * is delayed by the pad output delay (the receiver is clocked by the pad input
 * as if the clock was externally generated). This has the effect of decreasing

 * mode timing from the datasheet should be used for the receiver when this bit
 * is set. In synchronous mode, this bit allows the receiver to use the slave mode

 * This field has no effect when configured for an externally generated bit

 *
 * Reset value: 0xAA0FA000U
 *
 * The CRMR register allows you to demote the cache mode of various subregions
 * within the device's memory map. Demoting the cache mode reduces the cache
 * function applied to a memory region from write-back to write-through to
 * non-cacheable. After a region is demoted, its cache mode can only be raised by a reset,
 * which returns it to its default state. To maintain cache coherency, changes to
 * the cache mode should be completed while the address space being changed is
 * not being accessed or the cache is disabled. Before a cache mode change,
 * complete a cache clear all command to push and invalidate any cache entries that may
 * have changed. The address/module assignment of the 16 subregions is
 * device-specific and are detailed in the Chip Configuration section. Some of the regions
 * may not be used (non-cacheable), and some regions may not be capable of
 * write-back.

 * The CRMR register allows you to demote the cache mode of various subregions

 * function applied to a memory region from write-back to write-through to
 * non-cacheable. After a region is demoted, its cache mode can only be raised by a reset,
 * which returns it to its default state. To maintain cache coherency, changes to
 * the cache mode should be completed while the address space being changed is
 * not being accessed or the cache is disabled. Before a cache mode change,
 * complete a cache clear all command to push and invalidate any cache entries that may
 * have changed. The address/module assignment of the 16 subregions is
 * device-specific and are detailed in the Chip Configuration section. Some of the regions
 * may not be used (non-cacheable), and some regions may not be capable of
 * write-back.

 * Reset value: 0x04U
 *
 * The PMC contains an internal voltage regulator. The voltage regulator design
 * uses a bandgap reference that is also available through a buffer as input to
 * certain internal peripherals, such as the CMP and ADC. The internal regulator
 * provides a status bit (REGONS) indicating the regulator is in run regulation.
 * This register is reset on Chip Reset Not VLLS and by reset types that trigger
 * Chip Reset not VLLS. See the Reset section details for more information.

 *
 * This register is used to control the operation of data transfers. The host
 * driver shall set this register before issuing a command followed by a data
 * transfer, or before issuing a resume command. To prevent data loss, the SDHC
 * prevents writing to the bits that are involved in the data transfer of this
 * register, when data transfer is active. These bits are DPSEL, MBSEL, DTDSEL, AC12EN,
 * BCEN, and DMAEN. The host driver shall check PRSSTAT[CDIHB] and PRSSTAT[CIHB]
 * before writing to this register. When PRSSTAT[CDIHB] is set, any attempt to
 * send a command with data by writing to this register is ignored; when
 * PRSSTAT[CIHB] bit is set, any write to this register is ignored. On sending commands with
 * data transfer involved, it is mandatory that the block size is nonzero.
 * Besides, block count must also be nonzero, or indicated as single block transfer
 * (bit 5 of this register is 0 when written), or block count is disabled (bit 1 of
 * this register is 0 when written), otherwise SDHC will ignore the sending of
 * this command and do nothing. If the commands with data transfer does not
 * receive the response in 64 clock cycles, that is, response time-out, SDHC will
 * regard the external device does not accept the command and abort the data transfer.
 * In this scenario, the driver must issue the command again to retry the
 * transfer. It is also possible that, for some reason, the card responds to the
 * command but SDHC does not receive the response, and if it is internal DMA (either
 * simple DMA or ADMA) read operation, the external system memory is over-written
 * by the internal DMA with data sent back from the card. The following table
 * shows the summary of how register settings determine the type of data transfer.
 * Transfer Type register setting for various transfer types Multi/Single block
 * select Block count enable Block count Function 0 Don't care Don't care Single
 * transfer 1 0 Don't care Infinite transfer 1 1 Positive number Multiple transfer 1
 * 1 Zero No data transfer The following table shows the relationship between
 * XFERTYP[CICEN] and XFERTYP[CCCEN], in regards to XFERTYP[RSPTYP] as well as the
 * name of the response type. Relationship between parameters and the name of the
 * response type Response type (RSPTYP) Index check enable (CICEN) CRC check

 * 10 1 1 R1,R5,R6 11 1 1 R1b,R5b In the SDIO specification, response type
 * notation for R5b is not defined. R5 includes R5b in the SDIO specification. But R5b
 * is defined in this specification to specify that the SDHC will check the busy
 * status after receiving a response. For example, usually CMD52 is used with R5,
 * but the I/O abort command shall be used with R5b. The CRC field for R3 and R4
 * is expected to be all 1 bits. The CRC check shall be disabled for these

 * @name Register SDHC_SYSCTL, field SDCLKFS[15:8] (RW)
 *
 * Used to select the frequency of the SDCLK pin. The frequency is not

 * divisor (next register) of the base clock frequency register. Setting 00h bypasses
 * the frequency prescaler of the SD Clock. Multiple bits must not be set, or the
 * behavior of this prescaler is undefined. The two default divider values can
 * be calculated by the frequency of SDHC clock and the following divisor bits.
 * The frequency of SDCLK is set by the following formula: Clock frequency = (Base
 * clock) / (prescaler x divisor) For example, if the base clock frequency is 96
 * MHz, and the target frequency is 25 MHz, then choosing the prescaler value of
 * 01h and divisor value of 1h will yield 24 MHz, which is the nearest frequency
 * less than or equal to the target. Similarly, to approach a clock value of 400
 * kHz, the prescaler value of 08h and divisor value of eh yields the exact clock
 * value of 400 kHz. The reset value of this field is 80h, so if the input base
 * clock ( SDHC clock ) is about 96 MHz, the default SD clock after reset is 375
 * kHz. According to the SD Physical Specification Version 1.1 and the SDIO Card

 * @brief SDHC_IRQSTAT - Interrupt Status register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * An interrupt is generated when the Normal Interrupt Signal Enable is enabled
 * and at least one of the status bits is set to 1. For all bits, writing 1 to a
 * bit clears it; writing to 0 keeps the bit unchanged. More than one status can
 * be cleared with a single register write. For Card Interrupt, before writing 1
 * to clear, it is required that the card stops asserting the interrupt, meaning
 * that when the Card Driver services the interrupt condition, otherwise the CINT
 * bit will be asserted again. The table below shows the relationship between
 * the CTOE and the CC bits. SDHC status for CTOE/CC bit combinations Command
 * complete Command timeout error Meaning of the status 0 0 X X 1 Response not
 * received within 64 SDCLK cycles 1 0 Response received The table below shows the
 * relationship between the Transfer Complete and the Data Timeout Error. SDHC status
 * for data timeout error/transfer complete bit combinations Transfer complete
 * Data timeout error Meaning of the status 0 0 X 0 1 Timeout occurred during
 * transfer 1 X Data transfer complete The table below shows the relationship between
 * the command CRC Error (CCE) and Command Timeout Error (CTOE). SDHC status for
 * CCE/CTOE Bit Combinations Command complete Command timeout error Meaning of
 * the status 0 0 No error 0 1 Response timeout error 1 0 Response CRC error 1 1

 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * When the AC12ESEN bit in the Status register is set, the host driver shall
 * check this register to identify what kind of error the Auto CMD12 indicated.
 * This register is valid only when the Auto CMD12 Error status bit is set. The
 * following table shows the relationship between the Auto CMGD12 CRC error and the
 * Auto CMD12 command timeout error. Relationship between Command CRC Error and
 * Command Timeout Error For Auto CMD12 Auto CMD12 CRC error Auto CMD12 timeout
 * error Type of error 0 0 No error 0 1 Response timeout error 1 0 Response CRC
 * error 1 1 CMD line conflict Changes in Auto CMD12 Error Status register can be
 * classified in three scenarios: When the SDHC is going to issue an Auto CMD12: Set
 * bit 0 to 1 if the Auto CMD12 can't be issued due to an error in the previous
 * command. Set bit 0 to 0 if the auto CMD12 is issued. At the end bit of an auto
 * CMD12 response: Check errors corresponding to bits 1-4. Set bits 1-4
 * corresponding to detected errors. Clear bits 1-4 corresponding to detected errors.
 * Before reading the Auto CMD12 error status bit 7: Set bit 7 to 1 if there is a
 * command that can't be issued. Clear bit 7 if there is no command to issue. The
 * timing for generating the auto CMD12 error and writing to the command register
 * are asynchronous. After that, bit 7 shall be sampled when the driver is not
 * writing to the command register. So it is suggested to read this register only
 * when IRQSTAT[AC12E] is set. An Auto CMD12 error interrupt is generated when one
 * of the error bits (0-4) is set to 1. The command not issued by auto CMD12
 * error does not generate an interrupt.

 *
 * The Force Event (FEVT) register is not a physically implemented register.
 * Rather, it is an address at which the Interrupt Status register can be written if
 * the corresponding bit of the Interrupt Status Enable register is set. This
 * register is a write only register and writing 0 to it has no effect. Writing 1
 * to this register actually sets the corresponding bit of Interrupt Status
 * register. A read from this register always results in 0's. To change the
 * corresponding status bits in the interrupt status register, make sure to set
 * SYSCTL[IPGEN] so that bus clock is always active. Forcing a card interrupt will generate a
 * short pulse on the DAT[1] line, and the driver may treat this interrupt as a
 * normal interrupt. The interrupt service routine may skip polling the card
 * interrupt factor as the interrupt is selfcleared.

 *
 * When an ADMA error interrupt has occurred, the ADMA Error States field in
 * this register holds the ADMA state and the ADMA System Address register holds the
 * address around the error descriptor. For recovering from this error, the host
 * driver requires the ADMA state to identify the error descriptor address as
 * follows: ST_STOP: Previous location set in the ADMA System Address register is
 * the error descriptor address. ST_FDS: Current location set in the ADMA System
 * Address register is the error descriptor address. ST_CADR: This state is never
 * set because it only increments the descriptor pointer and doesn't generate an
 * ADMA error. ST_TFR: Previous location set in the ADMA System Address register
 * is the error descriptor address. In case of a write operation, the host driver
 * must use the ACMD22 to get the number of the written block, rather than using
 * this information, because unwritten data may exist in the host controller.
 * The host controller generates the ADMA error interrupt when it detects invalid
 * descriptor data (valid = 0) in the ST_FDS state. The host driver can
 * distinguish this error by reading the valid bit of the error descriptor. ADMA Error

 *
 * Reset value: 0x00012001U
 *
 * This register is intended to be used for programming, configuring and testing
 * the RNG. It is the main register to read/write, in order to enable Entropy
 * generation, to stop entropy generation and to block access to entropy registers.
 * This is done via the special TRNG_ACC and PRGM bits below. The RNG
 * Miscellaneous Control Register is a read/write register used to control the RNG's True
 * Random Number Generator (TRNG) access, operation and test. Note that in many
 * cases two RNG registers share the same address, and a particular register at the
 * shared address is selected based upon the value in the PRGM field of the MCTL
 * register.

 * Various statistical tests are run as a normal part of the TRNG's entropy
 * generation process. The least-significant 16 bits of the STATUS register reflect
 * the result of each of these tests. The status of these bits will be valid when
 * the TRNG has finished its entropy generation process. Software can determine
 * when this occurs by polling the ENT_VAL bit in the RNG Miscellaneous Control
 * Register. Note that there is a very small probability that a statistical test
 * will fail even though the TRNG is operating properly. If this happens the TRNG
 * will automatically retry the entire entropy generation process, including
 * running all the statistical tests. The value in RETRY_CT is decremented each time
 * an entropy generation retry occurs. If a statistical check fails when the retry
 * count is nonzero, a retry is initiated. But if a statistical check fails when
 * the retry count is zero, an error is generated by the RNG. By default
 * RETRY_CT is initialized to 1, but software can increase the retry count by writing to
 * the RTY_CT field in the SCMISC register. All 0s will be returned if this
 * register address is read while the RNG is in Program Mode (see PRGM field in MCTL

/*!
 * @brief USB_SOFTHLD - SOF Threshold register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00U
 *
 * The SOF Threshold Register is used only in Host mode (CTL[HOSTMODEEN]=1).
 * When in Host mode, the 14-bit SOF counter counts the interval between SOF frames.
 * The SOF must be transmitted every 1ms so therefore the SOF counter is loaded
 * with a value of 12000. When the SOF counter reaches zero, a Start Of Frame
 * (SOF) token is transmitted. The SOF threshold register is used to program the
 * number of USB byte times when SOFDYNTHLD=0, or 8 byte times when SOFDYNTHLD=1,
 * before the SOF stops initiating token packet transactions. This register must be
 * set to a value that ensures that other packets are not actively being
 * transmitted when the SOF time counts to zero. When the SOF counter reaches the
 * threshold value, no more tokens are transmitted until after the SOF has been
 * transmitted. The value programmed into the threshold register must reserve enough
 * time to ensure the worst case transaction completes. In general the worst case
 * transaction is an IN token followed by a data packet from the target followed by

/*!
 * @brief USB_ENDPT - Endpoint Control register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00U
 *
 * Contains the endpoint control bits for each of the 16 endpoints available
 * within the USB module for a decoded address. The format for these registers is
 * shown in the following figure. Endpoint 0 (ENDPT0) is associated with control
 * pipe 0, which is required for all USB functions. Therefore, after a USBRST
 * interrupt occurs the processor core should set ENDPT0 to contain 0x0D. In Host mode
 * ENDPT0 is used to determine the handshake, retry and low speed
 * characteristics of the host transfer. For Control, Bulk and Interrupt transfers, the EPHSHK
 * bit should be 1. For Isochronous transfers it should be 0. Common values to
 * use for ENDPT0 in host mode are 0x4D for Control, Bulk, and Interrupt transfers,
 * and 0x4C for Isochronous transfers. The three bits EPCTLDIS, EPRXEN, and
 * EPTXEN define if an endpoint is enabled and define the direction of the endpoint.
 * The endpoint enable/direction control is defined in the following table.
 * Endpoint enable and direction control EPCTLDIS EPRXEN EPTXEN Endpoint
 * enable/direction control X 0 0 Disable endpoint X 0 1 Enable endpoint for Tx transfers only
 * X 1 0 Enable endpoint for Rx transfers only 1 1 1 Enable endpoint for Rx and
 * Tx transfers 0 1 1 Enable Endpoint for RX and TX as well as control (SETUP)
 * transfers.
