# ESP32-C3 BSP Introduction

[中文](README_ZH.md) | English

This document records the execution instruction of the BSP (board support package) for the [ESP32-C3](http://luatos.com/t/esp32c3) development board.

The document is covered in two parts:

- Board Resources Introduction
- Quickly Get Started

## Resources Introduction

We tested 2 development boards, it all works, but due to the different LED pins of the two development boards, so we'll need to select the corresponding development board in the menuconfig.

### For more details about this board, please refer to [Here](https://wiki.luatos.com/chips/esp32c3/board.html).

## **Peripheral Condition**

Each peripheral supporting condition for this BSP is as follows:

| **On-board Peripherals** | ****Support**** | ****Remark****                                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GPIO                     | Support         |                                                              |
| UART                     | Support         | Using LUATOS_ESP32C3 development board requires connecting serial port to USB chip UART0_TX and UART0_RX (such as CP2102) |
| I2C              | Supported     | Hardware I2C may encounter transmission errors. Software I2C is recommended, but it occupies a general hardware system timer. |
| SPI              | Supported     | Supports custom configuration |
| JTAG debug               | Support         | ESP32C3 usb-linked development boards can be debugged        |
| WIFI | Partial support | There are currently some problems, such as `rt_mq_recive` cannot be used in ISR, etc. |
| BLE | Partially supported | There are currently some problems, such as `NimBLE` running errors after starting for a while |
| GDBStub | Support | You can use the GDB provided by ESP-IDF by turning on the `BSP_ENABLE_GDBSTUB` switch, which will enter GDB mode after a chip error |
| HWTIMER | Support |
Note:

1. WIFI and BLE cannot be enabled at the same time. When using the BLE driver, be sure to turn off the `RT_USING_WIFI` and `LWIP` switches in `menuconfig`. In addition, due to limited capabilities and lack of debugging equipment, there are problems with WIFI and BLE driver operation. If it can be solved, please contact [timwcx@qq.com](mailto:timwcx@qq.com).

2. The BLE driver only supports `NimBLE` and is provided by the `bluetooth` component in `esp-idf`. To use the BLE driver, please refer to `bsp/ESP32_C3/packages/ESP-IDF-latest/examples/bluetooth/nimble` Sample program, please note that the `esp_timer_init()` function must be called to initialize the clock driver before calling the `NimBLE` related interface.

One way to run the BLE sample is to add the sample program to `scons` compilation and call the clock initialization program and sample program entry in `bsp/ESP32_C3/main/main.c`.

```c
int main(void) {
   ...
#ifdef BSP_USING_BLE
     esp_timer_init(); //Call clock initialization program
     app_main(); //Call the BLE sample program entry
#endif
   ...
}
```

3、 Regarding the use of the GDBStub component, please see [ESP-IDF official documentation on GDBStub](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/zh_CN/latest/esp32c3/api-guides/tools/idf- monitor.html?#gdbstub-gdb), currently I have provided a debugging script `esp32c3.gdb`, the specific usage method is as follows.

```sh

## Environment construction and compilation

### Docker deploy

If you want to lightly experiment with the ESP32-C3, it is recommended to quickly set up the environment using Docker. Otherwise, use a native environment setup.

  1. Ensure Docker is installed and the inner network environment is properly configured. You can obtain the Docker image either via a pre-built docker image or by building it from a Dockerfile. Note that the docker image may not always be up-to-date, while the Dockerfile allows you to fetch the latest main branch. Below are the setup commands:
      * Setting up the development environment using a Dockerfile:

      ```sh
      cd docker
      sudo docker build --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=http://ip:port --build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=http://ip:port -t image_name .
      ``` 
      Replace ip:port with your proxy server's IP and port. Otherwise, network issues may occur when pulling repositories.

      * Setting up the development environment using a pre-built Docker image:

      ```sh
      sudo docker pull 1078249029/rtthread_esp32c3:latest
      ```

  2. Enter the Docker container:
  
      ```sh
      sudo docker run -it --device=/dev/ttyUSB* image_name
      ```

      The --device parameter is used for debugging and flashing code. You can obtain the corresponding port by running ls /dev/ttyUSB* on the host machine. If you used the pre-built Docker image, replace image_name with 1078249029/rtthread_esp32c3.

  3. Using the Environment:
   
      Flashing firmware:

        ```sh
        sudo esptool.py -b 115200 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size detect --flash_freq 80m 0x0 path/to/your/bootloader.bin 0x08000 path/to/your/partition-table.bin 0x010000 path/to/your/rtthread.bin
        ```

      Debugging:

        ```sh
        sudo minicom -c on -D /dev/ttyUSB*
        ```
### Native setup

1. Download the RISC-V toolchain:

     ```sh
     wget https://github.com/espressif/crosstool-NG/releases/download/esp-2022r1-RC1/riscv32-esp-elf-gcc11_2_0-esp-2022r1-RC1-linux-amd64.tar.xz
     tar xf riscv32-esp-elf-gcc11_2_0-esp-2022r1-RC1-linux-amd64.tar.xz
     ```

2. Configure the path of the toolchain:

     Add the local path of the `RISC-V` toolchain to the `EXEC_PATH` variable in the `rtconfig.py` file, or specify the path by setting the `RTT_EXEC_PATH` environment variable, for example:

     ```sh
     export RTT_EXEC_PATH=/opt/riscv32-esp-elf/bin
     ```

3. Compile

     Install esptool to convert ELF files to binary flash files:

     ```sh
     pip install esptool
     ```

     Execute the following command on the Linux platform to configure:

     ```
     scons --menuconfig
     ```

     It will automatically download env-related scripts to the `~/.env` directory, and then execute:

     ```sh
     source ~/.env/env.sh

     cd bsp/ESP32_C3/
     pkgs --update
     ```

     It will automatically download `RT-Thread-packages/esp-idf` and `RT-Thread-packages/FreeRTOS-Wrapper`, after updating the software packages, execute `scons` to compile the board support package.

     If the compilation is successful, `rtthread.elf`, `rtthread.bin` files will be generated.

## Download and program

In Windows, we can use *flash* supported by ESPRESSIF.

In Linux, we can use the esptool, which we have downloaded serval steps

### Windows

1. Programming tool download

     The current bsp test uses the [Flash Download Tools](https://www.espressif.com.cn/sites/default/files/tools/flash_download_tool_3.9.4_0.zip) tool to program without errors.

2. Programming tool configuration

     Chip model selection `ESP32-C3`

     Configure the binary file and offset address as follows:

     | binary file | offset address |
     | ------------------- | -------- |
     | bootloader.bin | 0x0 |
     | partition-table.bin | 0x8000 |
     | rtthread.bin | 0x10000 |

     Among them, `bootloader.bin` and `partition-table.bin` can be found in the `bsp/ESP32_C3/builtin_imgs` folder. After the configuration is completed, the screenshot is as follows, and then click `START` to download.

     ![flash_download_tools](images/flash_download_tools.png)

### Linux

```sh
esptool.py -b 115200 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size detect --flash_freq 80m 0x0 path/to/your/bootloader.bin 0x08000 path/to/your/partition-table.bin 0x010000 path/to/your/rtthread.bin
```
if you have more than one ESP device connected, you can use -p to choose which device to use.

if the command failed, check whether user ave enough privilige to access the serials. 

or we can check ESPRESSIF's [Troubleshooting](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/troubleshooting.html) to get more help.

## Notes

- The basic functions are now supported, but it needs more, welcome any contributions and feedback.
