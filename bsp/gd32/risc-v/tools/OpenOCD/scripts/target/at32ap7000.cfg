# Atmel AT32AP7000
#
# This is the only core in the now-inactive high end AVR32 product line,
# with MMU, Java Acceleration, and "pixel coprocessor".  The AP7 line
# is for "Application Processors" (AP) with 7-stage pipelines.
#
# Most current AVR32 parts are in the UC3 flash based microcontroller (UC)
# product line with 3-stage pipelines and without those extras.
#
# All AVR32 parts provide the Nexus Class 3 on-chip debug interfaces
# through their JTAG interfaces.
