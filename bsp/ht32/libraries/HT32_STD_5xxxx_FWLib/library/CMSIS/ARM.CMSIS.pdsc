      <description>
The Arm Cortex-M85 processor is a fully synthesizable high-performance microcontroller class processor that implements the Armv8.1-M Mainline architecture which includes support for the M-profile Vector Extension (MVE).
The processor also supports previous Armv8-M architectural features.
The design is focused on compute applications such as Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and machine learning.
The Arm Cortex-M85 processor is energy efficient and achieves high compute performance across scalar and vector operations while maintaining low power consumption.
