      Enable the system-level power management framework which coordinates
      suspend/resume, tickless idle, and device low-power states. Required when
      implementing sleep modes beyond simple tick suppression.

              Minimum idle duration (in milliseconds) before the PM core enters
              tickless mode. Tune based on wake-up latency vs power savings.
