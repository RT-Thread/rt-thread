## Usage Instructions

Usage instructions are divided into two sections:

- **Quick Start**

  This section is designed for beginners who are new to RT-Thread. By following simple steps, users can run the RT-Thread OS on the development board and observe the experimental results.

- **Advanced Usage**

  This section is for developers who need to use more of the development board's resources within the RT-Thread OS. By configuring the BSP using the ENV tool, additional onboard resources and advanced features can be enabled.

### Quick Start

This BSP currently provides GCC/IAR project support. Below is a guide using the [IAR Embedded Workbench for Arm](https://www.iar.com/products/architectures/arm/iar-embedded-workbench-for-arm/) development environment to run the system.

**Hardware Connection**

Connect the development board to the PC via a USB cable. Use the J-Link interface to download and debug the program.

**Compilation and Download**

- Navigate to the `bsp` directory and use the command `scons --target=iar` to generate the IAR project.
- Compile: Double-click the `project.eww` file to open the IAR project and compile the program.
- Debug: In the IAR navigation bar, click `Project -> Download and Debug` to download and start debugging.

**Viewing the Run Results**

After successfully downloading the program, the system will automatically run and print system information.

Connect the corresponding serial port of the development board to the PC. Open the relevant serial port (115200-8-1-N) in the terminal tool. After resetting the device, you can view the RT-Thread output. Enter the `help` command to see the list of supported system commands.

```bash

```

**Application Entry Function**

The entry function for the application layer is located in **src\hal_entry.c** within `void hal_entry(void)`. User source files can be placed directly in the `src` directory.

```c
void hal_entry(void)
{
    rt_kprintf("\nHello RT-Thread!\n");
    rt_kprintf("==================================================\n");
    rt_kprintf("This is an IAR project in RAM execution mode!\n");
    rt_kprintf("==================================================\n");

    while (1)
    {
        rt_pin_write(LED_PIN, PIN_HIGH);
        rt_thread_mdelay(500);
        rt_pin_write(LED_PIN, PIN_LOW);
        rt_thread_mdelay(500);
    }
}
```

**FSP Configuration**

To modify Renesas BSP peripheral configurations or add new peripheral ports, the Renesas [FSP](https://www2.renesas.cn/jp/zh/software-tool/flexible-software-package-fsp#document) configuration tool is required. Please follow the steps outlined below for configuration. For any questions regarding the configuration, please visit the [RT-Thread Community Forum](https://club.rt-thread.org/).

1. [Download the Flexible Software Package (FSP) | Renesas](https://github.com/renesas/rzn-fsp/releases/download/v2.0.0/setup_rznfsp_v2_0_0_rzsc_v2024-01.1.exe), use FSP version 2.0.0.
2. To add the **"EtherKit Board Support Package"** to FSP, refer to the document [How to Import a BSP](https://www2.renesas.cn/document/ppt/1527171?language=zh&r=1527191).
3. For guidance on configuring peripheral drivers using FSP, refer to the document: [Configuring Peripheral Drivers Using FSP for RA Series](https://www.rt-thread.org/document/site/#/rt-thread-version/rt-thread-standard/tutorial/make-bsp/renesas-ra/RA-series-using-FSP-configure-peripheral-drivers?id=ra-series-using-fsp-configure-peripheral-drivers).

**ENV Configuration**

- To learn how to use the ENV tool, refer to the [RT-Thread ENV Tool User Manual](https://www.rt-thread.org/document/site/#/development-tools/env/env).

By default, this BSP only enables the UART0 functionality. To use more advanced features such as components, software packages, and more, the ENV tool must be used for configuration.

The steps are as follows:
1. Open the ENV tool in the `bsp` directory.
2. Use the `menuconfig` command to configure the project. Save and exit once the configuration is complete.
3. Run the `pkgs --update` command to update the software packages.
4. Run the `scons --target=iar` command to regenerate the project.
