    - Improvements
      - Removed deprecated api in sdio driver.
      - Improved the signal line voltage switch flow.
      - Added powerOnDelayMS/powerOffDelayMS in sdio_usr_param_t to allow redefine the default power on/off delay.
      - Added mutual exclusive access for init/deinit/direct/extend function.
      - Fixed violations of MISRA C-2012 rule 4.7, 17.7, 10.1, 12.2.

  - 2.3.3
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed logical dead code coverity issue.
    - Improvements
      - Removed deprecated api in sdio driver.

  - 2.3.2
    - Improvements
      - Added host SDR timing mode capability validation during card initialization.
      - Used cache line size align buffer for SDIO initialization api.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed violations of MISRA C-2012 rule 11.9, 15.7, 4.7, 16.4, 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 11.3, 14.4, 10.6, 17.7, 16.1, 16.3.

  - 2.3.1
    - Improvements
      - Moved power off function after card detect in SD_Init for DAT3 detect card feature.

  - 2.3.0
    - Improvements
      - Marked api SDIO_HostReset/SDIO_PowerOnCard/SDIO_PowerOffCard/SDIO_WaitCardDetectStatus as deprecated.
      - Added new api SDIO_SetCardPower/SDIO_PollingCardDetectStatus/SDIO_HostDoReset.
      - Added internalBuffer in sdio_card_t for card register content extract and improve the data access efficiency.
      - Added retry function after switch to target timing failed in SDIO_SelectBusTiming.
      - Changed defalut bus clock from 400KHZ to 25MHZ.

  - 2.2.13
    - Improvements
      - Removed the sdio card interrupt from sdio host initialization, since the card interrupt enablement should be determined by application.

    - Improvements
      - Added manual tuning function for looking for the tuning window automatically.
      - Fixed the build warning by changing the old style function declaration static
        status_t inline to static inline status_t(found by adding
        -Wold-style-declaration in armgcc build flag).
      - Fixed the fall through build warning by adding SUPPRESS_FALL_THROUGH_WARNING() in sdio driver.

  - 2.2.11
    - Bug Fixes

  - 2.2.10
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed SDIO card driver get an incorrect io number when the card io number is
        bigger than 2.
    - Improvements
      - Added SDIO 3.0 support.
      - Added API SDIO_IO_RW_Direct for direct read/write card register access.

  - 2.2.9
    - Improvements
      - Added API SDIO_SetIOIRQHandler/SDIO_HandlePendingIOInterrupt to handle multi io pending IRQ.

  - 2.2.8
