config RT_USING_PHY
    bool "Using ethernet phy device drivers"
    default n
    help
      Enable the Ethernet PHY framework so MAC drivers can negotiate link state
      via MII/MDIO and apply vendor-specific fixes. Required when using RMII/RGMII
      external PHYs.

config RT_USING_PHY_V2
    bool "Using phy device and mii bus v2"
    depends on !RT_USING_PHY
    default n
    help
      Opt into the newer PHY/MDIO stack (version 2) which redesigns the PHY bus
      representation. Only enable this when migrating to the new API; it is
      mutually exclusive with the legacy PHY support.
