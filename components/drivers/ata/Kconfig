      Enable the ATA core so AHCI/legacy controllers can register themselves in
      the driver model, allocate DMA resources, and expose block devices to the
      RT-Thread block layer. Select this only on SoCs/boards that actually wire
      SATA ports because it pulls in the SCSI translation layer and requires DMA
      support. When disabled, no SATA disks will be enumerated.

      Build the generic AHCI driver that maps HBA registers (ports, command list,
      FIS receive, etc.), handles NCQ, and bridges each detected SATA device to
      the RT-SCSI mid-layer so filesystems can treat them like disks. Enable it
      whenever your SoC implements a standards-compliant AHCI core; disable if
      you rely on a vendor-specific ATA engine.

      Allow the AHCI driver to bind to PCI devices and fetch resources via PCI
      config space. Required on PC-class hardware where the AHCI HBA is behind
      PCI/PCIe; boards with platform AHCI (non-PCI) can leave this off to save a
      little code.
