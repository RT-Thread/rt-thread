# CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 BSP

## Overview

The CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 PSoC™ 6S2 Wi-Fi BT Pioneer Kit is a low-cost hardware platform that enables design and debug of PSoC™ 6 MCUs. It comes with a Murata 1LV Module (CYW43012 Wi-Fi + Bluetooth Combo Chip), industry-leading CAPSENSE™ for touch buttons and slider, on-board debugger/programmer with KitProg3, microSD card interface, 512-Mb Quad-SPI NOR flash, PDM-PCM microphone interface.

To use code from the BSP, simply include a reference to `cybsp.h`.

## Features

### Kit Features:

* Support of up to 2MB Flash and 1MB SRAM
* Dedicated SDHC to interface with WICED wireless devices.
* Delivers dual-cores, with a 150-MHz Arm Cortex-M4 as the primary application processor and a 100-MHz Arm Cortex-M0+ as the secondary processor for low-power operations.
* Supports Full-Speed USB, capacitive-sensing with CAPSENSE, a PDM-PCM digital microphone interface, a Quad-SPI interface, 13 serial communication blocks, 7 programmable analog blocks, and 56 programmable digital blocks.

### Kit Contents:

* PSoC™ 6S2 Wi-Fi BT Pioneer Board
* USB Type-A to Micro-B cable
* Quick Start Guide
* Four jumper wires (4 inches each)
* Two jumper wires (5 inches each)

## BSP Configuration

The BSP has a few hooks that allow its behavior to be configured. Some of these items are enabled by default while others must be explicitly enabled. Items enabled by default are specified in the CY8CKIT-062S2-43012.mk file. The items that are enabled can be changed by creating a custom BSP or by editing the application makefile.

Components:
* Device specific category reference (e.g.: CAT1) - This component, enabled by default, pulls in any device specific code for this board.
* BSP_DESIGN_MODUS - This component, enabled by default, causes the Configurator generated code for this specific BSP to be included. This should not be used at the same time as the CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS component.
* CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS - This component, disabled by default, causes the Configurator generated code from the application to be included. This assumes that the application provides configurator generated code. This should not be used at the same time as the BSP_DESIGN_MODUS component.

Defines:
* CYBSP_WIFI_CAPABLE - This define, disabled by default, causes the BSP to initialize the interface to an onboard wireless chip if it has one.
* CY_USING_HAL - This define, enabled by default, specifies that the HAL is intended to be used by the application. This will cause the BSP to include the applicable header file and to initialize the system level drivers.
* CYBSP_CUSTOM_SYSCLK_PM_CALLBACK - This define, disabled by default, causes the BSP to skip registering its default SysClk Power Management callback, if any, and instead to invoke the application-defined function `cybsp_register_custom_sysclk_pm_callback` to register an application-specific callback.

### Clock Configuration

| Clock    | Source    | Output Frequency |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| FLL      | IMO       | 100.0 MHz        |
| PLL      | IMO       | 48.0 MHz         |
| CLK_HF0  | CLK_PATH0 | 100 MHz          |

### Power Configuration

* System Active Power Mode: LP
* System Idle Power Mode: Deep Sleep
* VDDA Voltage: 3300 mV
* VDDD Voltage: 3300 mV

See the [BSP Setttings][settings] for additional board specific configuration settings.

## API Reference Manual

The CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 Board Support Package provides a set of APIs to configure, initialize and use the board resources.

See the [BSP API Reference Manual][api] for the complete list of the provided interfaces.
