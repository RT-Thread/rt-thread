  - 2.3.0
    - Improvements
      - Deprecated api MMC_PowerOnCard/MMC_PowerOffCard by api MMC_SetCardPower.
      - Added internalBuffer in mmc_card_t and removed rawCid/rawCsd/rawExtendedCsd.

  - 2.2.12
    - Improvement
      - Increased the CMD1 retry times in the MMC card driver to improve driver compatibility.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the build warning by changing the old style function declaration static
        status_t inline to static inline status_t(found by adding -Wold-style-declaration in armgcc build flag).

    - Improvements
      - Increased g_sdmmc 512byte to improve the performance when application use a non-word align data buffer address.
      - Used OCR access mode bits to determine the mmccard high capacity flag.

  - 2.2.3
