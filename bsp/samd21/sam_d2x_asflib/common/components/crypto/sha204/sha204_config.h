/** \brief number of command / response retries
 *
 * If communication is lost, re-synchronization includes waiting for the
 * longest possible execution time of a command.
 * This adds a #SHA204_COMMAND_EXEC_MAX delay to every retry.
 * Every increment of the number of retries increases the time
 * the library is spending in the retry loop by #SHA204_COMMAND_EXEC_MAX.
