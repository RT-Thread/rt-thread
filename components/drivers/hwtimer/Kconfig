      Enable the generic hardware-timer framework so SoC timer blocks can
      register themselves, expose capture/compare features, and provide high
      resolution timing services beyond the system tick. Select this for chips
      with general-purpose timers or watchdog-timer reuse; disable on systems
      that only rely on the software tick.

      Enable the driver for the ARM architectural timer (ARMv7-A/v8 system
      counter). This maps CNTFRQ/CNTV registers into the driver-model so the
      kernel can expose a precise clocksource/clockevent. Only useful on Cortex-
      A/R platforms that implement the generic timer block.
