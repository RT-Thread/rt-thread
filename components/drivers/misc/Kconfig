config RT_USING_ADC
    bool "Using ADC device drivers"
    default n
    help
      Enable analog-to-digital converter framework support so MCU ADC channels
      can be exposed through the RT-Thread device interface. Required when your
      application samples voltages or sensors via ADC.

config RT_USING_DAC
    bool "Using DAC device drivers"
    default n
    help
      Build the digital-to-analog converter driver layer. Enable if you need to
      output analog voltages or audio waveforms through DAC peripherals.

config RT_USING_NULL
    bool "Using NULL device drivers"
    default n
    help
      Register a `/dev/null` style sink device that discards written data and
      always returns EOF when read. Handy for tests or redirecting logs.

config RT_USING_ZERO
    bool "Using ZERO device drivers"
    default n
    help
      Provide a `/dev/zero` like device that returns zero-filled buffers on
      reads. Useful for quick buffer initialization without touching memory.

config RT_USING_RANDOM
    bool "Using RANDOM device drivers"
    default n
    help
      Expose a `/dev/random` source backed by software entropy or hardware RNG.
      Enable only when you supply a randomness provider.

config RT_USING_PWM
    bool "Using PWM device drivers"
    default n
    help
      Enable the Pulse-Width Modulation driver layer so timers configured as PWM
      can control motors, LEDs, etc. Required by many BSPs with PWM outputs.

config RT_USING_PULSE_ENCODER
    bool "Using PULSE ENCODER device drivers"
    default n
    help
      Build the pulse encoder (quadrature decoder) driver so incremental
      encoders can be read through the RT-Thread device API.

config RT_USING_INPUT_CAPTURE
    bool "Using INPUT CAPTURE device drivers"
    default n
    help
      Enable input capture support, letting timers timestamp external pulses for
      frequency/period measurements.

if RT_USING_INPUT_CAPTURE
    config RT_INPUT_CAPTURE_RB_SIZE
        int "Set input capture ringbuffer size"
        default 100
        help
          Number of samples buffered per capture channel. Increase to avoid data
          loss when interrupts arrive faster than the consumer drains them.
