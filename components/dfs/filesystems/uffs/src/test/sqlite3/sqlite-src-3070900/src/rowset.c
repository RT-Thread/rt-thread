**
** This module implements an object we call a "RowSet".
**
** The RowSet object is a collection of rowids.  Rowids
** are inserted into the RowSet in an arbitrary order.  Inserts
** can be intermixed with tests to see if a given rowid has been
** previously inserted into the RowSet.
**
** After all inserts are finished, it is possible to extract the
** elements of the RowSet in sorted order.  Once this extraction
** process has started, no new elements may be inserted.
**
** Hence, the primitive operations for a RowSet are:
**
**    CREATE
**    INSERT
**    TEST
**    SMALLEST
**    DESTROY
**
** The CREATE and DESTROY primitives are the constructor and destructor,
** obviously.  The INSERT primitive adds a new element to the RowSet.
** TEST checks to see if an element is already in the RowSet.  SMALLEST
** extracts the least value from the RowSet.
**
** The INSERT primitive might allocate additional memory.  Memory is
** allocated in chunks so most INSERTs do no allocation.  There is an 
** upper bound on the size of allocated memory.  No memory is freed
** until DESTROY.
**
** The TEST primitive includes a "batch" number.  The TEST primitive
** will only see elements that were inserted before the last change
** in the batch number.  In other words, if an INSERT occurs between
** two TESTs where the TESTs have the same batch nubmer, then the
** value added by the INSERT will not be visible to the second TEST.
** The initial batch number is zero, so if the very first TEST contains
** a non-zero batch number, it will see all prior INSERTs.
**
** No INSERTs may occurs after a SMALLEST.  An assertion will fail if
** that is attempted.
**
** The cost of an INSERT is roughly constant.  (Sometime new memory
** has to be allocated on an INSERT.)  The cost of a TEST with a new
** batch number is O(NlogN) where N is the number of elements in the RowSet.
** The cost of a TEST using the same batch number is O(logN).  The cost
** of the first SMALLEST is O(NlogN).  Second and subsequent SMALLEST
** primitives are constant time.  The cost of DESTROY is O(N).
**
** There is an added cost of O(N) when switching between TEST and
** SMALLEST primitives.
