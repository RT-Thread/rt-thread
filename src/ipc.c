 * @param    name is a pointer to the name you would like to give the semaphore.
 *
 * @param    value is the initial value for the semaphore.
 *           If used to share resources, you should initialize the value as the number of available resources.
 *           If used to signal the occurrence of an event, you should initialize the value as 0.
 *
 * @param    flag is the semaphore flag, which determines the queuing way of how multiple threads wait
 *           when the semaphore is not available.
 *           The semaphore flag can be ONE of the following values:
 *
 *               RT_IPC_FLAG_PRIO          The pending threads will queue in order of priority.
