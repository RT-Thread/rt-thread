      Enable the SCSI mid-layer which translates block requests to SCSI command
      packets. Needed by AHCI, USB Mass Storage, and NVMe drivers that expose
      disks as SCSI devices.

      Register disk-type SCSI devices (direct-access). Keep enabled unless you
      intentionally drop support for SCSI disks.

      Provide SCSI CD-ROM device emulation (read-only block devices). Disable
      only if optical-style devices are never needed.
