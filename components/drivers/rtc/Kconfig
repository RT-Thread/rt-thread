    help
      Enable the RTC core so hardware real-time clocks can be registered via
      `rt_hw_rtc_register`, the kernel can keep wall clock time across suspend/
      resume, and applications can query or set calendar values through the
      `rtc` character device. Turn this on whenever you have a peripheral or
      PMIC that supplies timestamp/backup registers referenced from the device
      tree; disable it only on chips that genuinely lack RTC hardware.

              Spawn the alarm service defined in `dev_alarm.c`. The driver
              creates an RT-Thread worker thread that reconciles user-space
              alarms with the RTC wakeup registers, automatically reprograms
              oneshot/periodic alarms, and raises callbacks when the hardware
              interrupt fires. Enable this if your application needs wakeup at a
              given date/time; leave it disabled to save RAM/CPU when alarms are
              not used.

                  Specify the stack size (bytes) used by the internal alarm
                  management thread. Increase this when alarm callbacks perform
                  complex logic or use libc time conversions; shrink it on very
                  constrained MCUs when you are sure the callbacks stay shallow.

                int "timeslice for alarm thread"

                  Define the timeslice (OS ticks) granted to the alarm thread
                  when it runs at the same priority as other time-sensitive
                  tasks. Lower values make the system more responsive at the
                  cost of additional context switches; higher values slightly
                  delay alarm handling under load.

            config RT_ALARM_PRIORITY

                  RT-Thread priority (smaller numbers are higher priority) of
                  the alarm management thread. Choose a priority above most
                  application threads if you require deterministic wakeups, or
                  below CPU-intensive tasks when alarm latency is less critical.

                help
                  Make the alarm service convert timestamps with `mktime()` so
                  alarms follow the configured local time zone instead of UTC.
                  Enable this when alarms must honor daylight saving or custom
                  offsets; otherwise keep it disabled to avoid the overhead of
                  repeatedly converting between UTC and local time.

              Build the tick-based software RTC implementation (`dev_soft_rtc`)
              for boards without dedicated RTC hardware. The driver keeps time
              by accumulating system ticks and stores values in RAM only, so it
              resets to the compile-time default after power loss. Enable it for
              simulations or low-cost MCUs that still need an `rtc` device node;
              disable it when real RTC registers are available to avoid two
              competing time sources.
