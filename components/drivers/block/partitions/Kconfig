    bool "DFS Partition support"
    depends on RT_USING_DFS
    default y
    help
      Parse the RT-Thread DFS partition table (vfs_part) so a single block
      device can be split into multiple named logical volumes. Enable this when
      you use the DFS tooling or `mkpart` scripts to carve flash storage; it is
      harmless to keep on because it only activates when the table signature is
      present.

config RT_BLK_PARTITION_EFI
    bool "EFI Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) Partition support"
    default y
    help
      Add GUID Partition Table (GPT) support, allowing disks formatted on
      modern PCs to be recognized. Required for SATA/NVMe/USB disks that use
      GPT; you may disable it on very small targets that only boot from DFS
      partitions to save a few kilobytes.
