    bool "Enable AT commands"

    help
        RT_USING_AT is the master switch for the "AT command framework" in the RT-Thread system.
        The AT command component provides a standardized framework for AT command parsing, registration, and response, adapting to various peripherals that support AT commands.
       
        It is disabled by default.

        help
            AT_DEBUG is a switch that enables debug logging output for the AT command framework.
            When enabled, it prints logs of AT commands, including "sent/received content," "parsing process," "response result," and "error reason."

            It is disabled by default.

        bool "Enable AT commands server"
        default n
        help
            AT_USING_SERVERAT is the AT server function switch.
            Its core function is to expand the AT command framework from "local serial port interaction mode" to "network/multi-channel service mode."
            When enabled, AT commands are no longer limited to local serial port transmission and reception.
            They can also receive and respond to AT commands through network channels such as TCP/UDP/virtual serial ports, enabling "remote AT debugging/control."

            It is disabled by default.

            default "uart3"
            help
                The core function of AT_SERVER_DEVICE is to specify the "underlying data transceiver device name" of the AT server.
                The command interaction of the AT server ultimately needs to be bound to a physical/virtual device as a data channel (such as a serial port or network device).

                By default, it is "uart3".

        config AT_SERVER_RECV_BUFF_LEN
            int "The maximum length of server data accepted"
            default 256
            help    
                The core function of AT_SERVER_RECV_BUFF_LEN is to define the "maximum buffer length" for the AT server to receive a single AT command.
                When receiving remote/serial AT commands, the AT server first stores the data in this buffer, and then parses it after the command is fully received.

                The default value is 256.

        config AT_SERVER_SEND_BUFF_LEN
            int "The maximum length of server commands buffer"
            default 256
            help
                The core function of AT_SERVER_SEND_BUFF_LEN is to define the "maximum buffer length" for the AT server to send AT command responses/issue commands.
                When the AT server returns command responses to a remote terminal/serial port or issues AT commands to a module, it first stores the data in this buffer before sending it in batches.

                The default value is 256.

        bool "Enable AT commands client"
        default n
        help
            The core function of AT_USING_CLIENT is to switch the AT framework from a "passive command response mode" to an "active command initiation mode."
            When enabled, the AT framework can act as an "AT client," actively sending AT commands to external AT devices and waiting for/parsing responses.

            It is disabled by default.

            help
                The core function of AT_CLIENT_NUM_MAX is to define the maximum number of AT client instances that can be created simultaneously within the AT framework.

                By default, the value range is 1-65535.

                help    
                    AT_USING_SOCKET is an AT socket adaptation switch within the AT command framework. Its core function is to enable the AT framework to provide a "BSD Socket standard API wrapper."
                    When enabled, network modules adapted to AT commands can directly call the standard BSD Socket API without needing to concern themselves with the underlying AT command details.

                    It is disabled by default; enabling it will also enable RT_USING_SAL and SAL_USING_AT.

                AT_USING_CLI is the AT command-line interaction switch within the AT framework.
                Its core function is to integrate AT commands into the RT-Thread FinSH command-line console.
                When enabled, AT commands can be entered directly in the FinSH terminal without requiring an additional serial port/network channel.

                It is enabled by default, but RT_USING_FINSH must be enabled.

                AT_PRINT_RAW_CMD is a switch for printing raw AT data within the AT command framework.
                Its core function is to print the raw binary/character data during AT command interaction.
                When enabled, it outputs unfiltered, unformatted AT transmit and receive data.
