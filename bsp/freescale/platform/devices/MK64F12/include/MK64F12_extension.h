 * @brief ADC_SC1 - ADC Status and Control Registers 1 (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x0000001FU
 *
 * SC1A is used for both software and hardware trigger modes of operation. To
 * allow sequential conversions of the ADC to be triggered by internal peripherals,
 * the ADC can have more than one status and control register: one for each
 * conversion. The SC1B-SC1n registers indicate potentially multiple SC1 registers
 * for use only in hardware trigger mode. See the chip configuration information
 * about the number of SC1n registers specific to this device. The SC1n registers
 * have identical fields, and are used in a "ping-pong" approach to control ADC
 * operation. At any one point in time, only one of the SC1n registers is actively
 * controlling ADC conversions. Updating SC1A while SC1n is actively controlling
 * a conversion is allowed, and vice-versa for any of the SC1n registers specific
 * to this MCU. Writing SC1A while SC1A is actively controlling a conversion
 * aborts the current conversion. In Software Trigger mode, when SC2[ADTRG]=0,
 * writes to SC1A subsequently initiate a new conversion, if SC1[ADCH] contains a
 * value other than all 1s. Writing any of the SC1n registers while that specific
 * SC1n register is actively controlling a conversion aborts the current conversion.
 * None of the SC1B-SC1n registers are used for software trigger operation and
 * therefore writes to the SC1B-SC1n registers do not initiate a new conversion.

 * @name Register ADC_SC1, field ADCH[4:0] (RW)
 *
 * Selects one of the input channels. The input channel decode depends on the
 * value of DIFF. DAD0-DAD3 are associated with the input pin pairs DADPx and
 * DADMx. Some of the input channel options in the bitfield-setting descriptions might
 * not be available for your device. For the actual ADC channel assignments for
 * your device, see the Chip Configuration details. The successive approximation
 * converter subsystem is turned off when the channel select bits are all set,
 * that is, ADCH = 11111. This feature allows explicit disabling of the ADC and
 * isolation of the input channel from all sources. Terminating continuous
 * conversions this way prevents an additional single conversion from being performed. It
 * is not necessary to set ADCH to all 1s to place the ADC in a low-power state
 * when continuous conversions are not enabled because the module automatically
 * enters a low-power state when a conversion completes.

 * Each PACR register consists of eight 4-bit PACR fields. Each PACR field
 * defines the access levels for a particular peripheral. The mapping between a

 * to each PACR is defined by the memory map slot that the peripheral is
 * assigned to. See this chip's memory map for the assignment of a particular
 * peripheral. The following table shows the location of each peripheral slot's PACR field
 * in the PACR registers. Offset Register [31:28] [27:24] [23:20] [19:16] [15:12]

 * @brief AXBS_PRS - Priority Registers Slave (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00543210U
 *
 * The priority registers (PRSn) set the priority of each master port on a per
 * slave port basis and reside in each slave port. The priority register can be
 * accessed only with 32-bit accesses. After the CRSn[RO] bit is set, the PRSn
 * register can only be read; attempts to write to it have no effect on PRSn and
 * result in a bus-error response to the master initiating the write. Two available
 * masters must not be programmed with the same priority level. Attempts to
 * program two or more masters with the same priority level result in a bus-error
 * response and the PRSn is not updated. Valid values for the Mn priority fields
 * depend on which masters are available on the chip. This information can be found in
 * the chip-specific information for the crossbar. If the chip contains less
 * than five masters, values 0 to 3 are valid. Writing other values will result in
 * an error. If the chip contains five or more masters, valid values are 0 to n-1,
 * where n is the number of masters attached to the AXBS module. Other values
 * will result in an error.

 * timer value is captured when the second bit of the identifier field of any frame
 * is on the CAN bus. This captured value is written into the Time Stamp entry
 * in a message buffer after a successful reception or transmission of a message.
 * If bit CTRL1[TSYN] is asserted, the Timer is reset whenever a message is
 * received in the first available Mailbox, according to CTRL2[RFFN] setting. The CPU
 * can write to this register anytime. However, if the write occurs at the same

 ******************************************************************************/

/*!
 * @brief CAN_ECR - Error Counter (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * This register has two 8-bit fields reflecting the value of two FlexCAN error
 * counters: Transmit Error Counter (TXERRCNT field) and Receive Error Counter
 * (RXERRCNT field). The rules for increasing and decreasing these counters are
 * described in the CAN protocol and are completely implemented in the FlexCAN
 * module. Both counters are read-only except in Freeze mode, where they can be
 * written by the CPU. FlexCAN responds to any bus state as described in the protocol,
 * for example, transmit Error Active or Error Passive flag, delay its
 * transmission start time (Error Passive) and avoid any influence on the bus when in Bus
 * Off state. The following are the basic rules for FlexCAN bus state transitions:
 * If the value of TXERRCNT or RXERRCNT increases to be greater than or equal to
 * 128, the FLTCONF field in the Error and Status Register is updated to reflect
 * 'Error Passive' state. If the FlexCAN state is 'Error Passive', and either
 * TXERRCNT or RXERRCNT decrements to a value less than or equal to 127 while the
 * other already satisfies this condition, the FLTCONF field in the Error and
 * Status Register is updated to reflect 'Error Active' state. If the value of
 * TXERRCNT increases to be greater than 255, the FLTCONF field in the Error and Status
 * Register is updated to reflect 'Bus Off' state, and an interrupt may be
 * issued. The value of TXERRCNT is then reset to zero. If FlexCAN is in 'Bus Off'
 * state, then TXERRCNT is cascaded together with another internal counter to count
 * the 128th occurrences of 11 consecutive recessive bits on the bus. Hence,
 * TXERRCNT is reset to zero and counts in a manner where the internal counter counts

 * At any instance of dominant bit following a stream of less than 11
 * consecutive recessive bits, the internal counter resets itself to zero without affecting
 * the TXERRCNT value. If during system start-up, only one node is operating,
 * then its TXERRCNT increases in each message it is trying to transmit, as a
 * result of acknowledge errors (indicated by the ACKERR bit in the Error and Status
 * Register). After the transition to 'Error Passive' state, the TXERRCNT does not
 * increment anymore by acknowledge errors. Therefore the device never goes to
 * the 'Bus Off' state. If the RXERRCNT increases to a value greater than 127, it
 * is not incremented further, even if more errors are detected while being a
 * receiver. At the next successful message reception, the counter is set to a value
 * between 119 and 127 to resume to 'Error Active' state.

 * @name Register CAN_CTRL2, field TASD[23:19] (RW)
 *
 * This 5-bit field indicates how many CAN bits the Tx arbitration process start
 * point can be delayed from the first bit of CRC field on CAN bus. This field
 * can be written only in Freeze mode because it is blocked by hardware in other
 * modes. This field is useful to optimize the transmit performance based on
 * factors such as: peripheral/serial clock ratio, CAN bit timing and number of MBs.
 * The duration of an arbitration process, in terms of CAN bits, is directly
 * proportional to the number of available MBs and CAN baud rate and inversely
 * proportional to the peripheral clock frequency. The optimal arbitration timing is
 * that in which the last MB is scanned right before the first bit of the
 * Intermission field of a CAN frame. Therefore, if there are few MBs and the system/serial
 * clock ratio is high and the CAN baud rate is low then the arbitration can be
 * delayed and vice-versa. If TASD is 0 then the arbitration start is not
 * delayed, thus the CPU has less time to configure a Tx MB for the next arbitration,
 * but more time is reserved for arbitration. On the other hand, if TASD is 24 then
 * the CPU can configure a Tx MB later and less time is reserved for
 * arbitration. If too little time is reserved for arbitration the FlexCAN may be not able
 * to find winner MBs in time to compete with other nodes for the CAN bus. If the
 * arbitration ends too much time before the first bit of Intermission field then
 * there is a chance that the CPU reconfigures some Tx MBs and the winner MB is
 * not the best to be transmitted. The optimal configuration for TASD can be
 * calculated as: TASD = 25 - {f CANCLK * [MAXMB + 3 - (RFEN * 8) - (RFEN * RFFN *
 * 2)] * 2} / {f SYS * [1+(PSEG1+1)+(PSEG2+1)+(PROPSEG+1)] * (PRESDIV+1)} where: f
 * CANCLK is the Protocol Engine (PE) Clock (see section "Protocol Timing"), in
 * Hz f SYS is the peripheral clock, in Hz MAXMB is the value in CTRL1[MAXMB]
 * field RFEN is the value in CTRL1[RFEN] bit RFFN is the value in CTRL2[RFFN] field
 * PSEG1 is the value in CTRL1[PSEG1] field PSEG2 is the value in CTRL1[PSEG2]

 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * These registers are located in RAM. RXIMR are used as acceptance masks for ID
 * filtering in Rx MBs and the Rx FIFO. If the Rx FIFO is not enabled, one mask
 * register is provided for each available Mailbox, providing ID masking
 * capability on a per Mailbox basis. When the Rx FIFO is enabled (MCR[RFEN] bit is
 * asserted), up to 32 Rx Individual Mask Registers can apply to the Rx FIFO ID Filter
 * Table elements on a one-to-one correspondence depending on the setting of
 * CTRL2[RFFN]. RXIMR can only be written by the CPU while the module is in Freeze
 * mode; otherwise, they are blocked by hardware. The Individual Rx Mask Registers
 * are not affected by reset and must be explicitly initialized prior to any
 * reception.

 * selected to execute. The channel priority registers assign the priorities; see
 * the DCHPRIn registers. For round-robin arbitration, the channel priorities are
 * ignored and channels are cycled through (from high to low channel number)
 * without regard to priority. For correct operation, writes to the CR register must
 * be performed only when the DMA channels are inactive; that is, when
 * TCDn_CSR[ACTIVE] bits are cleared. Minor loop offsets are address offset values added to
 * the final source address (TCDn_SADDR) or destination address (TCDn_DADDR) upon
 * minor loop completion. When minor loop offsets are enabled, the minor loop
 * offset (MLOFF) is added to the final source address (TCDn_SADDR), to the final
 * destination address (TCDn_DADDR), or to both prior to the addresses being
 * written back into the TCD. If the major loop is complete, the minor loop offset is
 * ignored and the major loop address offsets (TCDn_SLAST and TCDn_DLAST_SGA) are
 * used to compute the next TCDn_SADDR and TCDn_DADDR values. When minor loop
 * mapping is enabled (EMLM is 1), TCDn word2 is redefined. A portion of TCDn word2
 * is used to specify multiple fields: a source enable bit (SMLOE) to specify
 * the minor loop offset should be applied to the source address (TCDn_SADDR) upon
 * minor loop completion, a destination enable bit (DMLOE) to specify the minor
 * loop offset should be applied to the destination address (TCDn_DADDR) upon
 * minor loop completion, and the sign extended minor loop offset value (MLOFF). The
 * same offset value (MLOFF) is used for both source and destination minor loop
 * offsets. When either minor loop offset is enabled (SMLOE set or DMLOE set), the
 * NBYTES field is reduced to 10 bits. When both minor loop offsets are disabled
 * (SMLOE cleared and DMLOE cleared), the NBYTES field is a 30-bit vector. When
 * minor loop mapping is disabled (EMLM is 0), all 32 bits of TCDn word2 are
 * assigned to the NBYTES field.

 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The EEI register provides a bit map for the 16 channels to enable the error
 * interrupt signal for each channel. The state of any given channel's error
 * interrupt enable is directly affected by writes to this register; it is also
 * affected by writes to the SEEI and CEEI. The {S,C}EEI are provided so the error
 * interrupt enable for a single channel can easily be modified without the need to
 * perform a read-modify-write sequence to the EEI register. The DMA error
 * indicator and the error interrupt enable flag must be asserted before an error
 * interrupt request for a given channel is asserted to the interrupt controller.

 * The CINT provides a simple, memory-mapped mechanism to clear a given bit in
 * the INT to disable the interrupt request for a given channel. The given value
 * on a register write causes the corresponding bit in the INT to be cleared.
 * Setting the CAIR bit provides a global clear function, forcing the entire contents
 * of the INT to be cleared, disabling all DMA interrupt requests. If the NOP
 * bit is set, the command is ignored. This allows you to write multiple-byte
 * registers as a 32-bit word. Reads of this register return all zeroes.

/*!
 * @brief DMA_INT - Interrupt Request Register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The INT register provides a bit map for the 16 channels signaling the
 * presence of an interrupt request for each channel. Depending on the appropriate bit
 * setting in the transfer-control descriptors, the eDMA engine generates an
 * interrupt on data transfer completion. The outputs of this register are directly
 * routed to the interrupt controller (INTC). During the interrupt-service routine
 * associated with any given channel, it is the software's responsibility to
 * clear the appropriate bit, negating the interrupt request. Typically, a write to
 * the CINT register in the interrupt service routine is used for this purpose.
 * The state of any given channel's interrupt request is directly affected by
 * writes to this register; it is also affected by writes to the CINT register. On
 * writes to INT, a 1 in any bit position clears the corresponding channel's
 * interrupt request. A zero in any bit position has no affect on the corresponding
 * channel's current interrupt status. The CINT register is provided so the interrupt
 * request for a single channel can easily be cleared without the need to
 * perform a read-modify-write sequence to the INT register.

/*******************************************************************************

/*!
 * @brief DMA_ERR - Error Register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The ERR provides a bit map for the 16 channels, signaling the presence of an
 * error for each channel. The eDMA engine signals the occurrence of an error
 * condition by setting the appropriate bit in this register. The outputs of this
 * register are enabled by the contents of the EEI, and then routed to the
 * interrupt controller. During the execution of the interrupt-service routine associated
 * with any DMA errors, it is software's responsibility to clear the appropriate
 * bit, negating the error-interrupt request. Typically, a write to the CERR in
 * the interrupt-service routine is used for this purpose. The normal DMA channel
 * completion indicators (setting the transfer control descriptor DONE flag and
 * the possible assertion of an interrupt request) are not affected when an error
 * is detected. The contents of this register can also be polled because a
 * non-zero value indicates the presence of a channel error regardless of the state of
 * the EEI. The state of any given channel's error indicators is affected by
 * writes to this register; it is also affected by writes to the CERR. On writes to
 * the ERR, a one in any bit position clears the corresponding channel's error
 * status. A zero in any bit position has no affect on the corresponding channel's
 * current error status. The CERR is provided so the error indicator for a single
 * channel can easily be cleared.

 * As the channel completes the minor loop, this flag enables the linking to
 * another channel, defined by BITER[LINKCH]. The link target channel initiates a
 * channel service request via an internal mechanism that sets the TCDn_CSR[START]
 * bit of the specified channel. If channel linking is disabled, the BITER value
 * extends to 15 bits in place of a link channel number. If the major loop is
 * exhausted, this link mechanism is suppressed in favor of the MAJORELINK channel
 * linking. When the software loads the TCD, this field must be set equal to the
 * corresponding CITER field; otherwise, a configuration error is reported. As the
 * major iteration count is exhausted, the contents of this field is reloaded
 * into the CITER field.
 *
 * Values:
 * - 0b0 - The channel-to-channel linking is disabled
 * - 0b1 - The channel-to-channel linking is enabled

 * @brief ENET_MSCR - MII Speed Control Register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * MSCR provides control of the MII clock (MDC pin) frequency and allows a
 * preamble drop on the MII management frame. The MII_SPEED field must be programmed
 * with a value to provide an MDC frequency of less than or equal to 2.5 MHz to be
 * compliant with the IEEE 802.3 MII specification. The MII_SPEED must be set to
 * a non-zero value to source a read or write management frame. After the
 * management frame is complete, the MSCR register may optionally be cleared to turn
 * off MDC. The MDC signal generated has a 50% duty cycle except when MII_SPEED
 * changes during operation. This change takes effect following a rising or falling
 * edge of MDC. If the internal module clock is 25 MHz, programming this register
 * to 0x0000_0004 results in an MDC as stated in the following equation: 25 MHz
 * / ((4 + 1) x 2) = 2.5 MHz The following table shows the optimum values for
 * MII_SPEED as a function of internal module clock frequency. Programming Examples
 * for MSCR Internal MAC clock frequency MSCR [MII_SPEED] MDC frequency 25 MHz

 *
 * If TFWR[STRFWD] is cleared, TFWR[TFWR] controls the amount of data required

 * to be modified to match a given system requirement. For example, worst case
 * bus access latency by the transmit data DMA channel. When the FIFO level
 * reaches the value the TFWR field and when the STR_FWD is set to '0', the MAC
 * transmit control logic starts frame transmission even before the end-of-frame is
 * available in the FIFO (cut-through operation). If a complete frame has a size
 * smaller than the threshold programmed with TFWR, the MAC also transmits the Frame
 * to the line. To enable store and forward on the Transmit path, set STR_FWD to

 *
 * The STATUS register contains a copy of the status flag CHnF bit in CnSC for
 * each FTM channel for software convenience. Each CHnF bit in STATUS is a mirror
 * of CHnF bit in CnSC. All CHnF bits can be checked using only one read of
 * STATUS. All CHnF bits can be cleared by reading STATUS followed by writing 0x00 to
 * STATUS. Hardware sets the individual channel flags when an event occurs on the
 * channel. CHnF is cleared by reading STATUS while CHnF is set and then writing
 * a 0 to the CHnF bit. Writing a 1 to CHnF has no effect. If another event
 * occurs between the read and write operations, the write operation has no effect;
 * therefore, CHnF remains set indicating an event has occurred. In this case, a
 * CHnF interrupt request is not lost due to the clearing sequence for a previous
 * CHnF. The STATUS register should be used only in Combine mode.

 *
 * LLWU_F2 contains the wakeup flags indicating which wakeup source caused the

 * of a 1 to the corresponding WUFx bit. The wakeup flag (WUFx), if set, will
 * remain set if the associated WUPEx bit is cleared. This register is reset on Chip
 * Reset not VLLS and by reset types that trigger Chip Reset not VLLS. It is
 * unaffected by reset types that do not trigger Chip Reset not VLLS. See the
 * IntroductionInformation found here describes the registers of the Reset Control
 * Module (RCM). The RCM implements many of the reset functions for the chip. See the

 *
 * This register is used to control the operation of data transfers. The host
 * driver shall set this register before issuing a command followed by a data
 * transfer, or before issuing a resume command. To prevent data loss, the SDHC
 * prevents writing to the bits that are involved in the data transfer of this
 * register, when data transfer is active. These bits are DPSEL, MBSEL, DTDSEL, AC12EN,
 * BCEN, and DMAEN. The host driver shall check PRSSTAT[CDIHB] and PRSSTAT[CIHB]
 * before writing to this register. When PRSSTAT[CDIHB] is set, any attempt to
 * send a command with data by writing to this register is ignored; when
 * PRSSTAT[CIHB] bit is set, any write to this register is ignored. On sending commands with
 * data transfer involved, it is mandatory that the block size is nonzero.
 * Besides, block count must also be nonzero, or indicated as single block transfer
 * (bit 5 of this register is 0 when written), or block count is disabled (bit 1 of
 * this register is 0 when written), otherwise SDHC will ignore the sending of
 * this command and do nothing. For write command, with all above restrictions, it
 * is also mandatory that the write protect switch is not active (WPSPL bit of
 * Present State Register is 1), otherwise SDHC will also ignore the command. If
 * the commands with data transfer does not receive the response in 64 clock
 * cycles, that is, response time-out, SDHC will regard the external device does not
 * accept the command and abort the data transfer. In this scenario, the driver
 * must issue the command again to retry the transfer. It is also possible that,
 * for some reason, the card responds to the command but SDHC does not receive the
 * response, and if it is internal DMA (either simple DMA or ADMA) read
 * operation, the external system memory is over-written by the internal DMA with data
 * sent back from the card. The following table shows the summary of how register
 * settings determine the type of data transfer. Transfer Type register setting for

 * @name Register SDHC_SYSCTL, field SDCLKFS[15:8] (RW)
 *
 * Used to select the frequency of the SDCLK pin. The frequency is not

 * divisor (next register) of the base clock frequency register. Setting 00h bypasses
 * the frequency prescaler of the SD Clock. Multiple bits must not be set, or the
 * behavior of this prescaler is undefined. The two default divider values can
 * be calculated by the frequency of SDHC clock and the following divisor bits.
 * The frequency of SDCLK is set by the following formula: Clock frequency = (Base
 * clock) / (prescaler x divisor) For example, if the base clock frequency is 96
 * MHz, and the target frequency is 25 MHz, then choosing the prescaler value of
 * 01h and divisor value of 1h will yield 24 MHz, which is the nearest frequency
 * less than or equal to the target. Similarly, to approach a clock value of 400
 * kHz, the prescaler value of 08h and divisor value of eh yields the exact clock
 * value of 400 kHz. The reset value of this field is 80h, so if the input base
 * clock ( SDHC clock ) is about 96 MHz, the default SD clock after reset is 375
 * kHz. According to the SD Physical Specification Version 1.1 and the SDIO Card

 * Clock to support wakeup. In 4-bit mode, the card interrupt signal is sampled
 * during the interrupt cycle, so the interrupt from card can only be sampled

 * this bit is set again. To clear this bit, it is required to reset the interrupt
 * factor from the external card followed by a writing 1 to this bit. When this
 * status has been set, and the host driver needs to service this interrupt, the
 * Card Interrupt Signal Enable in the Interrupt Signal Enable register should be
 * 0 to stop driving the interrupt signal to the host system. After completion
 * of the card interrupt service (it must reset the interrupt factors in the SDIO

 *
 * Reset value: 0x117F013FU
 *
 * Setting the bits in this register to 1 enables the corresponding interrupt
 * status to be set by the specified event. If any bit is cleared, the
 * corresponding interrupt status bit is also cleared, that is, when the bit in this register
 * is cleared, the corresponding bit in interrupt status register is always 0.
 * Depending on PROCTL[IABG] bit setting, SDHC may be programmed to sample the
 * card interrupt signal during the interrupt period and hold its value in the
 * flip-flop. There will be some delays on the card interrupt, asserted from the card,
 * to the time the host system is informed. To detect a CMD line conflict, the
 * host driver must set both IRQSTATEN[CTOESEN] and IRQSTATEN[CCESEN] to 1.

 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * When the AC12ESEN bit in the Status register is set, the host driver shall
 * check this register to identify what kind of error the Auto CMD12 indicated.
 * This register is valid only when the Auto CMD12 Error status bit is set. The
 * following table shows the relationship between the Auto CMGD12 CRC error and the
 * Auto CMD12 command timeout error. Relationship between Command CRC Error and
 * Command Timeout Error For Auto CMD12 Auto CMD12 CRC error Auto CMD12 timeout
 * error Type of error 0 0 No error 0 1 Response timeout error 1 0 Response CRC
 * error 1 1 CMD line conflict Changes in Auto CMD12 Error Status register can be
 * classified in three scenarios: When the SDHC is going to issue an Auto CMD12: Set
 * bit 0 to 1 if the Auto CMD12 can't be issued due to an error in the previous
 * command. Set bit 0 to 0 if the auto CMD12 is issued. At the end bit of an auto
 * CMD12 response: Check errors corresponding to bits 1-4. Set bits 1-4
 * corresponding to detected errors. Clear bits 1-4 corresponding to detected errors.
 * Before reading the Auto CMD12 error status bit 7: Set bit 7 to 1 if there is a
 * command that can't be issued. Clear bit 7 if there is no command to issue. The
 * timing for generating the auto CMD12 error and writing to the command register
 * are asynchronous. After that, bit 7 shall be sampled when the driver is not
 * writing to the command register. So it is suggested to read this register only
 * when IRQSTAT[AC12E] is set. An Auto CMD12 error interrupt is generated when one
 * of the error bits (0-4) is set to 1. The command not issued by auto CMD12
 * error does not generate an interrupt.

 *
 * When an ADMA error interrupt has occurred, the ADMA Error States field in

 * address around the error descriptor. For recovering from this error, the host
 * driver requires the ADMA state to identify the error descriptor address as
 * follows: ST_STOP: Previous location set in the ADMA System Address register is
 * the error descriptor address. ST_FDS: Current location set in the ADMA System
 * Address register is the error descriptor address. ST_CADR: This state is never
 * set because it only increments the descriptor pointer and doesn't generate an
 * ADMA error. ST_TFR: Previous location set in the ADMA System Address register
 * is the error descriptor address. In case of a write operation, the host driver
 * must use the ACMD22 to get the number of the written block, rather than using
 * this information, because unwritten data may exist in the host controller.
 * The host controller generates the ADMA error interrupt when it detects invalid
 * descriptor data (valid = 0) in the ST_FDS state. The host driver can

 * @brief UART_S1 - UART Status Register 1 (RO)
 *
 * Reset value: 0xC0U
 *
 * The S1 register provides inputs to the MCU for generation of UART interrupts
 * or DMA requests. This register can also be polled by the MCU to check the
 * status of its fields. To clear a flag, the status register should be read followed
 * by a read or write to D register, depending on the interrupt flag type. Other
 * instructions can be executed between the two steps as long the handling of
 * I/O is not compromised, but the order of operations is important for flag
 * clearing. When a flag is configured to trigger a DMA request, assertion of the
 * associated DMA done signal from the DMA controller clears the flag. If the
 * condition that results in the assertion of the flag, interrupt, or DMA request is not
 * resolved prior to clearing the flag, the flag, and interrupt/DMA request,
 * reasserts. For example, if the DMA or interrupt service routine fails to write
 * sufficient data to the transmit buffer to raise it above the watermark level, the
 * flag reasserts and generates another interrupt or DMA request. Reading an
 * empty data register to clear one of the flags of the S1 register causes the FIFO
 * pointers to become misaligned. A receive FIFO flush reinitializes the
 * pointers. A better way to prevent this situation is to always leave one byte in FIFO
 * and this byte will be read eventually in clearing the flag bit.

 *
 * This register is actually two separate registers. Reads return the contents
 * of the read-only receive data register and writes go to the write-only transmit
 * data register. In 8-bit or 9-bit data format, only UART data register (D)
 * needs to be accessed to clear the S1[RDRF] bit (assuming receiver buffer level is
 * less than RWFIFO[RXWATER]). The C3 register needs to be read, prior to the D
 * register, only if the ninth bit of data needs to be captured. Similarly, the
 * ED register needs to be read, prior to the D register, only if the additional
 * flag data for the dataword needs to be captured. In the normal 8-bit mode (M
 * bit cleared) if the parity is enabled, you get seven data bits and one parity
 * bit. That one parity bit is loaded into the D register. So, for the data bits,
 * mask off the parity bit from the value you read out of this register. When
 * transmitting in 9-bit data format and using 8-bit write instructions, write first
 * to transmit bit 8 in UART control register 3 (C3[T8]), then D. A write to
 * C3[T8] stores the data in a temporary register. If D register is written first,
 * and then the new data on data bus is stored in D, the temporary value written by
 * the last write to C3[T8] gets stored in the C3[T8] register.

 * Reset value: 0x00U
 *
 * The SOF Threshold Register is used only in Host mode (HOSTMODEEN=1). When in
 * Host mode, the 14-bit SOF counter counts the interval between SOF frames. The
 * SOF must be transmitted every 1ms so therefore the SOF counter is loaded with
 * a value of 12000. When the SOF counter reaches zero, a Start Of Frame (SOF)
 * token is transmitted. The SOF threshold register is used to program the number
 * of USB byte times before the SOF to stop initiating token packet transactions.
 * This register must be set to a value that ensures that other packets are not
 * actively being transmitted when the SOF time counts to zero. When the SOF
 * counter reaches the threshold value, no more tokens are transmitted until after the
 * SOF has been transmitted. The value programmed into the threshold register
 * must reserve enough time to ensure the worst case transaction completes. In
 * general the worst case transaction is an IN token followed by a data packet from
 * the target followed by the response from the host. The actual time required is
 * a function of the maximum packet size on the bus. Typical values for the SOF
 * threshold are: 64-byte packets=74; 32-byte packets=42; 16-byte packets=26;
 * 8-byte packets=18.
