      Enable the MFD framework so composite chips (PMICs, southbridges, etc.)
      described in device tree can expose multiple child devices (GPIO, RTC,
      regulator…) through the driver model. Required when your board uses such
      multifunction ICs; disable to save code if every device is standalone.

      Provide the syscon helper that maps register banks described by
      `syscon`/`simple-mfd` nodes and allows other drivers to read/write them.
      Keep enabled on SoCs whose reset/clock/PHY drivers access syscon regions.
