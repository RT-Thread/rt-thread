### 1.3 Quickly Get Started

This BSP provides MDK4, MDK5, and IAR projects for developers and it supports the GCC development environment. Here's an example of the MDK5 development environment, to introduce how to run the system.

Then, the necessary libraries should be pulled; otherwise, the compilation will fail.

```bash
    pkgs --update
```

### 1.4 Hardware Connection

Use a cable to connect the development board to the PC and turn on the power switch.

### 1.5 Compile and Download

Double-click the `project.uvprojx` file to open the MDK5 project, compile and download the program to the development board.

> The project defaults to use the CMSIS-DAP emulator to download the program, and as we're connecting the development board via USB, click the Download button can directly download the program to the development board

### 1.6 Running Results

After the program is successfully downloaded, the system runs automatically. Observe the running results of the LED on the development board, the LED will light in 1Hz.

Connect the corresponding serial port of the development board to the PC, and when the corresponding serial port ( 115200-8-1-N) is opened in the terminal tool, the output information of RT-Thread can be seen when the device is reset:

### 1.7 **Advanced Features**

This BSP only enables GPIO and UART1 by default. If you need more advanced features such as SD Card, Flash, or you need to configure the BSP with RT-Thread homegrown [ENV tool](https://www.rt-thread.io/download.html?download=Env), as follows:

1. Open the ENV tool under the specific BSP folder;
2. Enter `menuconfig` command to configure the project, then save and exit;
3. Enter `pkgs --update` command to update the package;
4. Enter `scons --target=mdk4/mdk5/iar` command to regenerate the project.

## 2 MIMXRT1060-EVK User Manual

This manual records the execution instruction of the MIMXRT1060-EVK on RT-Thread homebuilt IDE RT-Thread Studio. 

### 2.1 Preparation

- Clone the RT-Thread repository from GitHub to your local. [Link](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread)
- Download and install RT-Thread Studio. [Link](https://www.rt-thread.io/studio.html)
- Prepare the [RW007](https://github.com/RT-Thread-packages/rw007/blob/master/README.md) module.

### 2.2 Quickly Get Started

#### 2.2.1 menuconfig to configure the project

Open the directory where the MIMXRT1060-EVK BSP is located and use the menuconfig command in the [ENV tool](https://www.rt-thread.io/download.html?download=Env) to configure the project

![](./figures/6.png)

#### 2.2.2 Cancel the configuration that is not needed, as follows:

Set the Onboard Peripheral Drivers option:

![](./figures/4.png)

Set the On-chip Peripheral Drivers option:

![](./figures/5.png)

### 2.3 Go to File, and click the Import

![](./figures/1_en.png)

### 2.4 Import RT-Thread BSP to workspace 

![](./figures/2_en.png)

### 2.5 Fill out the project info

![](./figures/3_en.png)

### 2.6 Compile project

![](./figures/8.png)

Till now, the project is compiled, and the preparation is completed.

## 3 Use RT-Studio to Configure BSP Driver 

Each BSP of RT-Thread already has several drivers by default, such as on-chip peripheral driver and on-board peripheral driver, and the drivers can be enabled by opening the corresponding configuration and setting the parameters according to the use environment on RT-Studio IDE. Since the pin has the multiplexing function, it may not have both the available on-chip peripheral driver and on-board peripheral driver at the same time, so it is necessary to check the schematic while enabling the corresponding peripheral drivers.

RT-Thread has a lot of up-for-grab software packages, by using RT-Studio IDE, the software packages can be easily added to the project.

## 4 Connect to Internet: Use the RW007 module

The RW007 is a high-speed WIFI module that uses SPI to communicate with the host. Check the [User Manual](https://github.com/RT-Thread-packages/rw007/blob/master/README.md).

The SPI interface provided by the MIMXRT1060-EVK onboard Arduino interface has duplicate pins with the pins used by the SDIO interface of the SD card, so the on-board SPI interface is not connected by default. We'll be needing you to connect it, check out the location marked DNP in the schematic diagram below (this step is necessary when using the SPI interface). You can use the SPI interface led by the onboard Arduino interface, in this case, the on-board SD card slot is not available.

Solder works must be done before next step:

### 4.1 Configure the onboard SPI peripherals

RW007 supports SPI interface for communication, MIMXRT1060-EVK supports SPI driver, defaults to using polling mode to communicate with RW007 (currently it does not support interrupt and DMA mode to communicate with RW007), the following shows how to use RT-Studio to configure SPI:

![](./figures/10_en.png)

### 4.2 Configure the RW007 package using RT-Studio

Click the RT-Thread Settings option on the left, there is a configuration menu will be shown on the right, enter RW007 in the search bar, and select `rw007:SPI WIFI rw007 driver`, the corresponding configuration parameters are as follows:

![](./figures/9_en.png)

### 4.3 Plug the RW007 module into the onboard Arduino interface

![](./figures/12.png)

### 4.4 Modify the RW007 example
RW007 has been ported into IMXRT1062 platform, the port file is at: `board/ports/rw007_port.c`, Once we select RW007 package, it will join into our project automatically, there is no need to modify any code for simply turn on  this module.

### 4.5 After the modification is completed, compile the project and burn the firmware

![](./figures/13.png)

`rw007 sn` and `rw007 ver` are successfully output, and RW007 driver is successfully connected. 

### 4.6 WIFI connection test

Enter the `wifi scan` command into the shell to search for WIFI.

![](./figures/14.png)

Enter `wifi` and press `tab` to list wifi-related commands:

![](./figures/15.png)

Use the ping command to test if the WIFI connection is available:

![](./figures/16.png)

At this point, the basic environment of the MIMXRT1060-EVK is successfully set up!
