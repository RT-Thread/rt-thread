      Enable the common clock framework so SoC clock providers can register
      themselves and consumers can obtain `struct rt_clk` handles to manage
      gate, mux and divider trees. This is required by most complex drivers
      (MMC, Ethernet, display) because they explicitly prepare and enable their
      input clocks before accessing hardware. The framework relies on the DM
      bus and device tree clock references, so disable it only on the smallest
      MCUs where every peripheral runs off the same fixed clock and no driver
      ever calls into the clock API.
