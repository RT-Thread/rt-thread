/**
   \mainpage CMSIS DSP Software Library
   *
   * \section intro Introduction
   *
   * This user manual describes the CMSIS DSP software library,
   * a suite of common signal processing functions for use on Cortex-M and Cortex-A processor
   * based devices.
   *
   * The library is divided into a number of functions each covering a specific category:
   * - Basic math functions
   * - Fast math functions
   * - Complex math functions
   * - Filtering functions
   * - Matrix functions
   * - Transform functions
   * - Motor control functions
   * - Statistical functions
   * - Support functions
   * - Interpolation functions
   * - Support Vector Machine functions (SVM)
   * - Bayes classifier functions
   * - Distance functions
   * - Quaternion functions
   *
   * The library has generally separate functions for operating on 8-bit integers, 16-bit integers,
   * 32-bit integer and 32-bit floating-point values.
   *
   * The library is providing vectorized versions of most algorthms for Helium
   * and of most f32 algorithms for Neon.
   *
   * When using a vectorized version, provide a little bit of padding after the end of
   * a buffer (3 words) because the vectorized code may read a little bit after the end
   * of a buffer. You don't have to modify your buffers but just ensure that the
   * end of buffer + padding is not outside of a memory region.
   *
   * \section using Using the Library
   *
   * The library is released in source form. It is strongly advised to compile the library using -Ofast to
   * have the best performances.
   *
   * The library functions are declared in the public file <code>arm_math.h</code> which is placed in the <code>Include</code> folder.
   * Simply include this file. If you don't want to include everything, you can also rely
   * on headers in Include/dsp folder and use only what you need.
   *
   * \section example Examples
   *
   * The library ships with a number of examples which demonstrate how to use the library functions.
   *
   * \section toolchain Toolchain Support
   *
   * The library is now tested on Fast Models building with cmake.
   * Core M0, M4, M7, M33, M55, A32 are tested.
   *
   *
   * \section preprocessor Preprocessor Macros
   *
   * Each library project have different preprocessor macros.
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_BIG_ENDIAN:
   *
   * Define macro ARM_MATH_BIG_ENDIAN to build the library for big endian targets. By default library builds for little endian targets.
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_MATRIX_CHECK:
   *
   * Define macro ARM_MATH_MATRIX_CHECK for checking on the input and output sizes of matrices
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_ROUNDING:
   *
   * Define macro ARM_MATH_ROUNDING for rounding on support functions
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_LOOPUNROLL:
   *
   * Define macro ARM_MATH_LOOPUNROLL to enable manual loop unrolling in DSP functions
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_NEON:
   *
   * Define macro ARM_MATH_NEON to enable Neon versions of the DSP functions.
   * It is not enabled by default when Neon is available because performances are
   * dependent on the compiler and target architecture.
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_NEON_EXPERIMENTAL:
   *
   * Define macro ARM_MATH_NEON_EXPERIMENTAL to enable experimental Neon versions of
   * of some DSP functions. Experimental Neon versions currently do not have better
   * performances than the scalar versions.
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_HELIUM:
   *
   * It implies the flags ARM_MATH_MVEF and ARM_MATH_MVEI and ARM_MATH_MVE_FLOAT16.
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_HELIUM_EXPERIMENTAL:
   *
   * Only taken into account when ARM_MATH_MVEF, ARM_MATH_MVEI or ARM_MATH_MVE_FLOAT16 are defined.
   * Enable some vector versions which may have worse performance than scalar
   * depending on the core / compiler configuration.
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_MVEF:
   *
   * Select Helium versions of the f32 algorithms.
   * It implies ARM_MATH_FLOAT16 and ARM_MATH_MVEI.
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_MVEI:
   *
   * Select Helium versions of the int and fixed point algorithms.
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_MVE_FLOAT16:
   *
   * MVE Float16 implementations of some algorithms (Requires MVE extension).
   *
   * - DISABLEFLOAT16:
   *
   * Disable float16 algorithms when __fp16 is not supported for a
   * specific compiler / core configuration.
   * This is only valid for scalar. When vector architecture is
   * supporting f16 then it can't be disabled.
   *
   * - ARM_MATH_AUTOVECTORIZE:
   *
   * With Helium or Neon, disable the use of vectorized code with C intrinsics
   * and use pure C instead. The vectorization is then done by the compiler.
