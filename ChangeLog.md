版本: RT-Threadv2.0.1及v2.1.0 alpha

RT-Thread v2.0.1是2.0这个系列的bug修正版，而v2.1.0 alpha则是当前开发主干的一个技术预览版本，它给出了v2.1.0这个版本系列的技术预览情况，不建议用于实际产品中，因为它可能存在大量的一些bug。

# RT-Thread v2.0.1更改说明

*  IAR用的dlib，加入THREAD_SUPPORT 和 FILE_DESCRIPTOR的支持；
*  修正finsh中echo回显模式的问题；
*  修正USB host代码的编译错误；
*  修正sensor框架回调函数的问题；
*  修正pin设备注册时的设备名称问题；

而v2.1.0 alpha这个技术预览版则沿着最初设定的roadmap技术路线进行，这其中主要包括：

*  lwip更深度的集成：把它集成到RT-Thread的文件系统接口中，这样Linux/Unix下的一些socket网络应用能够更顺利的移植到RT-Thread上，也为以后可以应用到更多地方的select接口铺路。

*  这部分是和RT-Thread发布本身无关，但也是这个版本系列设定的目标之一：开启一个云端集成开发环境的时代！云端会是什么样的，请用现代化的浏览器打开[CloudIDE](http://lab.rt-thread.org/cloudide/simulator/index.html)

# RT-Thread 2.0.0 RC 更改说明

发布时间:2014/11/4

随着RT-Thread功能越来越多，如何发布版本也成为一件头疼的事情，因为需要仔细对比最近三个月来的修改记录。这次的发布距离上一次beta版本依然是三个月的时间，但按照发布计划已然推迟了一个月进行发布。

在这三个月中，开源社区上也发生了很多有趣的事情：

阿嘉的使用RT-Thread的四轴飞行器毕业设计惊艳亮相，采用了1个STM32F4 + 8个STM32F1进行飞行控制，总计9个MCU的另类实现方式；沿循四轴飞行器的路线，与国内匿名团队合作，采用RW009 Wi-Fi控制的迷你四轴飞行器也在稳步推进过程中。

RT-Thread做为一个开源组织参与的CSDN开源夏令营结出了丰硕的果实：
由hduffddybz参与的IPv6协议栈移植（最新版本的lwIP-head版本移植）在这次发布中已经包括进来，从而能够在使用RT-Thread的小型设备上实现TCP/IP v4/v6双栈的支持；
由wzyy2参与的GDB stub实现，也完美的支持BeagleBoneBlack开发板和STM32F4平台；
CSDN开源夏令营其他的成果，例如bluedroid移植也有了初步的成果，希望能够在后续的版本（可能会是2.1.0系列版本？）包含进来。CSDN开源夏令营是一次非常棒的活动，能够让学生提前进入实战，了解软件开发的初步知识。对开源社区来说，也是一次非常有益的社区互动活动。希望明年这个活动可以继续，关注RT-Thread、嵌入式开发的同学可以关注明年的动向。

当前智能化设备是一个备受关注的领域，针对这一领域的特点，RT-Thread也相
