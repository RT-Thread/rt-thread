# Sayma AMC is an FPGA board for the µTCA AMC format
# The board is open hardware (CERN OHL) and the gateware and software
# running on it are open source (ARTIQ, LGPLv3+).
#
# https://github.com/m-labs/sinara/wiki/Sayma
#
# It contains a Xilinx Kintex Ultrascale 040 FPGA (xcku040).
# There is a SCANSTA112SM JTAG router on the board which is configured to
# automatically add devices to the JTAG svcan chain when they are added.
# Sayma AMC is usually combined with Sayma RTM (rear transition module)
# which features an Artix 7 FPGA.

# Add the RTM Artix to the chain. Note that this changes the PLD numbering.
# Unfortunately openocd TAPs can't be disabled after they have been added and
