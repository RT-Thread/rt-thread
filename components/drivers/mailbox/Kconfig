      Enable the mailbox framework so multi-core SoCs or remote processors can
      exchange messages via hardware mailbox/FIFO IP. The core registers mailbox
      controllers described in device tree, manages channel timeouts, and
      exposes asynchronous send/receive callbacks to drivers such as RPMsg or
      audio DSP clients. Disable it only when the SoC lacks mailbox hardware.

      Build the PIC mailbox controller driver which exposes RT-Thread's
      platform interrupt controller mailboxes through the common API. Select it
      when the firmware runs on platforms where the PIC provides mailbox
      registers (for example Sophgo SG2042); turning it off prevents those DTS
      nodes from binding.
