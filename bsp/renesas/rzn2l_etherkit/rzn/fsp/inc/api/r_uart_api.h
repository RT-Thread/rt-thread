 * @section UART_INTERFACE_SUMMARY Summary
 * The UART interface provides common APIs for UART HAL drivers. The UART interface supports the following features:
 * - Full-duplex UART communication
 * - Interrupt driven transmit/receive processing
 * - Callback function with returned event code
 * - Runtime baud-rate change
 * - Hardware resource locking during a transaction
 * - CTS/RTS hardware flow control support (with an associated IOPORT pin)
