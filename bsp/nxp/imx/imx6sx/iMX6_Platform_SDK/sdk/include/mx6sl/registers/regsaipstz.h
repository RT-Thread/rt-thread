 * Reset value: 0x0496ed40
 *
 * Each AIPSTZ_MPR specifies 16 4-bit fields defining the access privilege level associated with a
 * bus master in the platform, as well as specifying whether write accesses from this master are
 * bufferable shown in The registers provide one field per bus master, where field 15 corresponds to
 * master 15, field 14 to master 14,... field 0 to master 0 (typically the processor core). The
 * master index allocation is shown in . MPROT Field Bit Field Description 3 MBW Master Buffer
 * Writes - This bit determines whether the AIPSTZ is enabled to buffer writes from this master. 2
 * MTR Master Trusted for Reads - This bit determines whether the master is trusted for read
 * accesses. 1 MTW Master Trusted for Writes - This bit determines whether the master is trusted for
 * write accesses. 0 MPL Master Privilege Level - This bit determines how the privilege level of the
 * master is determined. The reset value is set to 0000_0000_7700_0000, which makes master 0 and
 * master 1 (ARM CORE) the trusted masters. Trusted software can change the settings after reset.
 * Master Index Allocation Master Index Master Name Comments Master 0 All masters excluding ARM core
 * and SDMA Share the same number allocation. Master 1 ARM CORE Master 2 Reserved Master 3 SDMA
