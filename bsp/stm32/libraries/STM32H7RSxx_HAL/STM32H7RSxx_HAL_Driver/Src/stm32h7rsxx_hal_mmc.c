  ==============================================================================
                        ##### How to use this driver #####
  ==============================================================================
  [..]
    This driver implements a high level communication layer for read and write from/to
    this memory. The needed STM32 hardware resources (SDMMC and GPIO) are performed by
    the user in HAL_MMC_MspInit() function (MSP layer).
    Basically, the MSP layer configuration should be the same as we provide in the
    examples.
    You can easily tailor this configuration according to hardware resources.

  [..]
    This driver is a generic layered driver for SDMMC memories which uses the HAL
    SDMMC driver functions to interface with MMC and eMMC cards devices.
    It is used as follows:

    (#)Initialize the SDMMC low level resources by implement the HAL_MMC_MspInit() API:
        (##) Enable the SDMMC interface clock using __HAL_RCC_SDMMC_CLK_ENABLE();
        (##) SDMMC pins configuration for MMC card
            (+++) Enable the clock for the SDMMC GPIOs using the functions __HAL_RCC_GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE();
            (+++) Configure these SDMMC pins as alternate function pull-up using HAL_GPIO_Init()
                  and according to your pin assignment;
        (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process (HAL_MMC_ReadBlocks_IT()
             and HAL_MMC_WriteBlocks_IT() APIs).
            (+++) Configure the SDMMC interrupt priorities using function HAL_NVIC_SetPriority();
            (+++) Enable the NVIC SDMMC IRQs using function HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ()
            (+++) SDMMC interrupts are managed using the macros __HAL_MMC_ENABLE_IT()
                  and __HAL_MMC_DISABLE_IT() inside the communication process.
            (+++) SDMMC interrupts pending bits are managed using the macros __HAL_MMC_GET_IT()
                  and __HAL_MMC_CLEAR_IT()
        (##) No general propose DMA Configuration is needed, an Internal DMA for SDMMC Peripheral are used.

    (#) At this stage, you can perform MMC read/write/erase operations after MMC card initialization

  *** MMC Card Initialization and configuration ***
  ================================================
  [..]
    To initialize the MMC Card, use the HAL_MMC_Init() function. It Initializes
    SDMMC Peripheral (STM32 side) and the MMC Card, and put it into StandBy State (Ready for data transfer).
    This function provide the following operations:

    (#) Initialize the SDMMC peripheral interface with default configuration.
        The initialization process is done at 400KHz. You can change or adapt
        this frequency by adjusting the "ClockDiv" field.
        The MMC Card frequency (SDMMC_CK) is computed as follows:

           SDMMC_CK = SDMMCCLK / (2 * ClockDiv)

        In initialization mode and according to the MMC Card standard,
        make sure that the SDMMC_CK frequency doesn't exceed 400KHz.

        This phase of initialization is done through SDMMC_Init() and
        SDMMC_PowerState_ON() SDMMC low level APIs.

    (#) Initialize the MMC card. The API used is HAL_MMC_InitCard().
        This phase allows the card initialization and identification
        and check the MMC Card type (Standard Capacity or High Capacity)
        The initialization flow is compatible with MMC standard.

        This API (HAL_MMC_InitCard()) could be used also to reinitialize the card in case
        of plug-off plug-in.

    (#) Configure the MMC Card Data transfer frequency. By Default, the card transfer
        frequency by adjusting the "ClockDiv" field.
        In transfer mode and according to the MMC Card standard, make sure that the
        SDMMC_CK frequency doesn't exceed 25MHz and 100MHz in High-speed mode switch.

    (#) Select the corresponding MMC Card according to the address read with the step 2.

    (#) Configure the MMC Card in wide bus mode: 4-bits data.
    (#) Select the MMC Card partition using HAL_MMC_SwitchPartition()

        by adjusting the "NumberOfBlocks" parameter.

    (+) __HAL_MMC_GET_FLAG:Check whether the specified MMC flag is set or not
    (+) __HAL_MMC_CLEAR_FLAG: Clear the MMC's pending flags

  [..]
    (@) You can refer to the MMC HAL driver header file for more useful macros

  *** Callback registration ***
  =============================================
  [..]
    The compilation define USE_HAL_MMC_REGISTER_CALLBACKS when set to 1
    allows the user to configure dynamically the driver callbacks.

    Use Functions HAL_MMC_RegisterCallback() to register a user callback,
    it allows to register following callbacks:
      (+) TxCpltCallback : callback when a transmission transfer is completed.
      (+) RxCpltCallback : callback when a reception transfer is completed.
      (+) ErrorCallback : callback when error occurs.
      (+) AbortCpltCallback : callback when abort is completed.
      (+) Read_DMALnkLstBufCpltCallback : callback when the DMA reception of linked list node buffer is completed.
      (+) Write_DMALnkLstBufCpltCallback : callback when the DMA transmission of linked list node buffer is completed.
      (+) MspInitCallback    : MMC MspInit.
      (+) MspDeInitCallback  : MMC MspDeInit.
    This function takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle, the Callback ID
    and a pointer to the user callback function.

    Use function HAL_MMC_UnRegisterCallback() to reset a callback to the default
    weak (overridden) function. It allows to reset following callbacks:
      (+) TxCpltCallback : callback when a transmission transfer is completed.
      (+) RxCpltCallback : callback when a reception transfer is completed.
      (+) ErrorCallback : callback when error occurs.
      (+) AbortCpltCallback : callback when abort is completed.
      (+) Read_DMADblBuf0CpltCallback : callback when the DMA reception of first buffer is completed.
      (+) Read_DMADblBuf1CpltCallback : callback when the DMA reception of second buffer is completed.
      (+) Write_DMADblBuf0CpltCallback : callback when the DMA transmission of first buffer is completed.
      (+) Write_DMADblBuf1CpltCallback : callback when the DMA transmission of second buffer is completed.
      (+) MspInitCallback    : MMC MspInit.
      (+) MspDeInitCallback  : MMC MspDeInit.
    This function) takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle and the Callback ID.

    By default, after the HAL_MMC_Init and if the state is HAL_MMC_STATE_RESET
    all callbacks are reset to the corresponding legacy weak (overridden) functions.
    Exception done for MspInit and MspDeInit callbacks that are respectively
    reset to the legacy weak (overridden) functions in the HAL_MMC_Init
    and HAL_MMC_DeInit only when these callbacks are null (not registered beforehand).
    If not, MspInit or MspDeInit are not null, the HAL_MMC_Init and HAL_MMC_DeInit
    keep and use the user MspInit/MspDeInit callbacks (registered beforehand)

    Callbacks can be registered/unregistered in READY state only.
    Exception done for MspInit/MspDeInit callbacks that can be registered/unregistered
    in READY or RESET state, thus registered (user) MspInit/DeInit callbacks can be used
    during the Init/DeInit.
    In that case first register the MspInit/MspDeInit user callbacks
    using HAL_MMC_RegisterCallback before calling HAL_MMC_DeInit
    or HAL_MMC_Init function.

    When The compilation define USE_HAL_MMC_REGISTER_CALLBACKS is set to 0 or
    not defined, the callback registering feature is not available
    and weak (overridden) callbacks are used.
