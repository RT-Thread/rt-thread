      This framework will be of use only to devices that use
      external PHY (PHY functionality is not embedded within the controller).

      Enable support for generic USB PHY devices that follow the
      "usb-nop-xceiv" device tree binding. This driver provides basic
      PHY operations including reset, power management, and clock control
      for USB PHY hardware.
