# You can create .clang-format-ignore (https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html#clang-format-ignore) files to make clang-format ignore certain files. A .clang-format-ignore file consists of patterns of file path names. It has the following format:
# - A blank line is skipped.
# - Leading and trailing spaces of a line are trimmed.
# - A line starting with a hash (#) is a comment.
# - A non-comment line is a single pattern.
# - The slash (/) is used as the directory separator.
# - A pattern is relative to the directory of the .clang-format-ignore file (or the root directory if the pattern starts with a slash). Patterns containing drive names (e.g. C:) are not supported.
# - Patterns follow the rules specified in POSIX 2.13.1, 2.13.2, and Rule 1 of 2.13.3.
# - Bash globstar (**) is supported.
# - A pattern is negated if it starts with a bang (!).
# To match all files in a directory, use e.g. foo/bar/*. To match all files in the directory of the .clang-format-ignore file, use *. Multiple .clang-format-ignore files are supported similar to the .clang-format files, with a lower directory level file voiding the higher level ones.
