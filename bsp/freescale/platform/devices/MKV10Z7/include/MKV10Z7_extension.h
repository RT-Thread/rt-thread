 * @brief ADC_SC1 - ADC Status and Control Registers 1 (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x0000001FU
 *
 * SC1A is used for both software and hardware trigger modes of operation. To
 * allow sequential conversions of the ADC to be triggered by internal peripherals,
 * the ADC can have more than one status and control register: one for each
 * conversion. The SC1B-SC1n registers indicate potentially multiple SC1 registers
 * for use only in hardware trigger mode. See the chip configuration information
 * about the number of SC1n registers specific to this device. The SC1n registers
 * have identical fields, and are used in a "ping-pong" approach to control ADC
 * operation. At any one point in time, only one of the SC1n registers is actively
 * controlling ADC conversions. Updating SC1A while SC1n is actively controlling
 * a conversion is allowed, and vice-versa for any of the SC1n registers specific
 * to this MCU. Writing SC1A while SC1A is actively controlling a conversion
 * aborts the current conversion. In Software Trigger mode, when SC2[ADTRG]=0,
 * writes to SC1A subsequently initiate a new conversion, if SC1[ADCH] contains a
 * value other than all 1s. Writing any of the SC1n registers while that specific
 * SC1n register is actively controlling a conversion aborts the current conversion.
 * None of the SC1B-SC1n registers are used for software trigger operation and
 * therefore writes to the SC1B-SC1n registers do not initiate a new conversion.

 * @name Register ADC_SC1, field ADCH[4:0] (RW)
 *
 * Selects one of the input channels. The input channel decode depends on the
 * value of DIFF. DAD0-DAD3 are associated with the input pin pairs DADPx and
 * DADMx. Some of the input channel options in the bitfield-setting descriptions might
 * not be available for your device. For the actual ADC channel assignments for
 * your device, see the Chip Configuration details. The successive approximation
 * converter subsystem is turned off when the channel select bits are all set,
 * that is, ADCH = 11111. This feature allows explicit disabling of the ADC and
 * isolation of the input channel from all sources. Terminating continuous
 * conversions this way prevents an additional single conversion from being performed. It
 * is not necessary to set ADCH to all 1s to place the ADC in a low-power state
 * when continuous conversions are not enabled because the module automatically
 * enters a low-power state when a conversion completes.

 * The CRC Data register contains the value of the seed, data, and checksum.
 * When CTRL[WAS] is set, any write to the data register is regarded as the seed

 * data for general CRC computation. In 16-bit CRC mode, the HU and HL fields are
 * not used for programming the seed value, and reads of these fields return an
 * indeterminate value. In 32-bit CRC mode, all fields are used for programming
 * the seed value. When programming data values, the values can be written 8 bits,
 * 16 bits, or 32 bits at a time, provided all bytes are contiguous; with MSB of
 * data value written first. After all data values are written, the CRC result
 * can be read from this data register. In 16-bit CRC mode, the CRC result is
 * available in the LU and LL fields. In 32-bit CRC mode, all fields contain the
 * result. Reads of this register at any time return the intermediate CRC value,
 * provided the CRC module is configured.

/*!
 * @brief DMA_CR - Control Register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The CR defines the basic operating configuration of the DMA. Arbitration can
 * be configured to use either a fixed-priority or a round-robin scheme. For
 * fixed-priority arbitration, the highest priority channel requesting service is
 * selected to execute. The channel priority registers assign the priorities; see
 * the DCHPRIn registers. For round-robin arbitration, the channel priorities are
 * ignored and channels are cycled through (from high to low channel number)
 * without regard to priority. For correct operation, writes to the CR register must
 * be performed only when the DMA channels are inactive; that is, when
 * TCDn_CSR[ACTIVE] bits are cleared. Minor loop offsets are address offset values added to
 * the final source address (TCDn_SADDR) or destination address (TCDn_DADDR) upon
 * minor loop completion. When minor loop offsets are enabled, the minor loop
 * offset (MLOFF) is added to the final source address (TCDn_SADDR), to the final
 * destination address (TCDn_DADDR), or to both prior to the addresses being
 * written back into the TCD. If the major loop is complete, the minor loop offset is
 * ignored and the major loop address offsets (TCDn_SLAST and TCDn_DLAST_SGA) are
 * used to compute the next TCDn_SADDR and TCDn_DADDR values. When minor loop
 * mapping is enabled (EMLM is 1), TCDn word2 is redefined. A portion of TCDn word2
 * is used to specify multiple fields: a source enable bit (SMLOE) to specify
 * the minor loop offset should be applied to the source address (TCDn_SADDR) upon
 * minor loop completion, a destination enable bit (DMLOE) to specify the minor
 * loop offset should be applied to the destination address (TCDn_DADDR) upon
 * minor loop completion, and the sign extended minor loop offset value (MLOFF). The
 * same offset value (MLOFF) is used for both source and destination minor loop
 * offsets. When either minor loop offset is enabled (SMLOE set or DMLOE set), the
 * NBYTES field is reduced to 10 bits. When both minor loop offsets are disabled
 * (SMLOE cleared and DMLOE cleared), the NBYTES field is a 30-bit vector. When
 * minor loop mapping is disabled (EMLM is 0), all 32 bits of TCDn word2 are
 * assigned to the NBYTES field.

 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The INT register provides a bit map for the 4 channels signaling the presence
 * of an interrupt request for each channel. Depending on the appropriate bit
 * setting in the transfer-control descriptors, the eDMA engine generates an
 * interrupt on data transfer completion. The outputs of this register are directly
 * routed to the interrupt controller (INTC). During the interrupt-service routine
 * associated with any given channel, it is the software's responsibility to clear
 * the appropriate bit, negating the interrupt request. Typically, a write to
 * the CINT register in the interrupt service routine is used for this purpose. The
 * state of any given channel's interrupt request is directly affected by writes
 * to this register; it is also affected by writes to the CINT register. On
 * writes to INT, a 1 in any bit position clears the corresponding channel's
 * interrupt request. A zero in any bit position has no affect on the corresponding
 * channel's current interrupt status. The CINT register is provided so the interrupt
 * request for a single channel can easily be cleared without the need to perform
 * a read-modify-write sequence to the INT register.

 *
 * This register configures the PWM synchronization. A synchronization event can
 * perform the synchronized update of MOD, CV, and OUTMASK registers with the
 * value of their write buffer and the FTM counter initialization. The software
 * trigger, SWSYNC bit, and hardware triggers TRIG0, TRIG1, and TRIG2 bits have a
 * potential conflict if used together when SYNCMODE = 0. Use only hardware or
 * software triggers but not both at the same time, otherwise unpredictable behavior
 * is likely to happen. The selection of the loading point, CNTMAX and CNTMIN
 * bits, is intended to provide the update of MOD, CNTIN, and CnV registers across
 * all enabled channels simultaneously. The use of the loading point selection
 * together with SYNCMODE = 0 and hardware trigger selection, TRIG0, TRIG1, or TRIG2
 * bits, is likely to result in unpredictable behavior. The synchronization
 * event selection also depends on the PWMSYNC (MODE register) and SYNCMODE (SYNCONF

 * to 1. A transfer begins. The MCU signals the I2C module to enter stop mode. The
 * byte currently being transferred, including both address and data, completes
 * its transfer. The I2C slave or master acknowledges that the in-transfer byte
 * completed its transfer and acknowledges the request to enter stop mode. After
 * receiving the I2C module's acknowledgment of the request to enter stop mode,
 * the MCU determines whether to shut off the I2C module's clock. If the SHEN bit
 * is set to 1 and the I2C module is in an idle or disabled state when the MCU
 * signals to enter stop mode, the module immediately acknowledges the request to
 * enter stop mode. If SHEN is cleared to 0 and the overall data transmission or
 * reception that was suspended by stop mode entry was incomplete: To resume the
 * overall transmission or reception after the MCU exits stop mode, software must
 * reinitialize the transfer by resending the address of the slave. If the I2C
 * Control Register 1's IICIE bit was set to 1 before the MCU entered stop mode,
 * system software will receive the interrupt triggered by the I2C Status Register's
 * TCF bit after the MCU wakes from the stop mode.

 * @brief MTB_POSITION - MTB Position Register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The MTB_POSITION register contains the Trace Write Address Pointer and Wrap
 * fields. This register can be modified by the explicit programming model writes.
 * It is also automatically updated by the MTB hardware when trace packets are
 * being recorded. The base address of the system RAM in the memory map dictates
 * special consideration for the placement of the MTB. Consider the following
 * guidelines: For the standard configuration where the size of the MTB is <= 25% of
 * the total RAM capacity, it is recommended the MTB be based at the address
 * defined by the MTB_BASE register. The read-only MTB_BASE register is defined by
 * the expression (0x2000_0000 - (RAM_Size/4)). For this configuration, the
 * MTB_POSITION register is initialized to MTB_BASE & 0x0000_7FF8. If the size of the
 * MTB is more than 25% but less than or equal to 50% of the total RAM capacity, it
 * is recommended the MTB be based at address 0x2000_0000. In this
 * configuration, the MTB_POSITION register is initialized to (0x2000_0000 & 0x0000_7FF8) =
 * 0x0000_00000. Following these two suggested placements provides a full-featured
 * circular memory buffer containing program trace packets. In the unlikely event
 * an even larger trace buffer is required, a write-once capacity of 75% of the
 * total RAM capacity can be based at address 0x2000_0000. The MTB_POSITION
 * register is initialized to (0x2000_0000 & 0x0000_7FF8) = 0x0000_0000. However, this
 * configuration cannot support operation as a circular queue and instead
 * requires the use of the MTB_FLOW[WATERMARK] capability to automatically disable
 * tracing or halting the processor as the number of packet writes approach the
 * buffer capacity. See the MTB_FLOW register description for more details.

 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * Specifies data to be transferred to the TX FIFO and CMD FIFO. An 8- or 16-bit
 * write access to the TXDATA field transfers the 16 bits of data to the TX
 * FIFO. A write access to the command fields transfers the 16 bits of command
 * information to the CMD FIFO. In Master mode, the register transfers 16 bits of data
 * to the TX FIFO and 16 bits of command information to the CMD FIFO. In Slave
 * mode, the CMD FIFO is not used and the 16 bits of command information are
 * reserved. The TX FIFO and CMD FIFO must be filled simultaneously. In other words,
 * you must perform write accesses to both the data and command fields for every
 * PUSHR operation. Because both the TX FIFO and CMD FIFO are written to and read
 * from simultaneously, they behave as a single 32 bit FIFO. A read access of
 * PUSHR returns the topmost TX FIFO and CMD FIFO entries concatenated. When the
 * module is disabled, writing to this register does not update the FIFO. Therefore,
 * any reads performed while the module is disabled return the last PUSHR write
 * performed while the module was still enabled.

 * @brief UART_S1 - UART Status Register 1 (RO)
 *
 * Reset value: 0xC0U
 *
 * The S1 register provides inputs to the MCU for generation of UART interrupts
 * or DMA requests. This register can also be polled by the MCU to check the
 * status of its fields. To clear a flag, the status register should be read followed
 * by a read or write to D register, depending on the interrupt flag type. Other
 * instructions can be executed between the two steps as long the handling of
 * I/O is not compromised, but the order of operations is important for flag
 * clearing. When a flag is configured to trigger a DMA request, assertion of the
 * associated DMA done signal from the DMA controller clears the flag. If the
 * condition that results in the assertion of the flag, interrupt, or DMA request is not
 * resolved prior to clearing the flag, the flag, and interrupt/DMA request,
 * reasserts. For example, if the DMA or interrupt service routine fails to write
 * sufficient data to the transmit buffer to raise it above the watermark level, the
 * flag reasserts and generates another interrupt or DMA request. Reading an
 * empty data register to clear one of the flags of the S1 register causes the FIFO
 * pointers to become misaligned. A receive FIFO flush reinitializes the
 * pointers. A better way to prevent this situation is to always leave one byte in FIFO
 * and this byte will be read eventually in clearing the flag bit.

 * This register is actually two separate registers. Reads return the contents
 * of the read-only receive data register and writes go to the write-only transmit
 * data register. In 8-bit or 9-bit data format, only UART data register (D)
 * needs to be accessed to clear the S1[RDRF] bit (assuming receiver buffer level is
 * less than RWFIFO[RXWATER]). The C3 register needs to be read, prior to the D
 * register, only if the ninth bit of data needs to be captured. Similarly, the
 * ED register needs to be read, prior to the D register, only if the additional
 * flag data for the dataword needs to be captured. In the normal 8-bit mode (M
 * bit cleared) if the parity is enabled, you get seven data bits and one parity
 * bit. That one parity bit is loaded into the D register. So, for the data bits,
 * mask off the parity bit from the value you read out of this register. When
 * transmitting in 9-bit data format and using 8-bit write instructions, write first
 * to transmit bit 8 in UART control register 3 (C3[T8]), then D. A write to
 * C3[T8] stores the data in a temporary register. If D register is written first,
 * and then the new data on data bus is stored in D, the temporary value written by
 * the last write to C3[T8] gets stored in the C3[T8] register.
