      Enable the Memory Technology Device (MTD) NOR layer so SPI/QSPI or
      parallel NOR flashes can be registered and exposed to the filesystem or
      FAL. Select this when your design stores code/data in NOR.

      Enable NAND flash management (bad-block handling, ECC hooks, partitions).
      Requires platform-specific ECC support and is needed for raw NAND storage.
