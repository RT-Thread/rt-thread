      Enable the generic block-device infrastructure so storage controllers can
      register disks/partitions and the RT-Thread DFS layer can mount them.
      Almost every filesystem, SDIO, SATA or NAND driver depends on this. Turn
      it off only on firmware builds that never interact with block media.
