# Configuration for the ST SPEAr300 Evaluation board
# EVALSPEAr300 Rev. 1.0, modified to enable SRST on JTAG connector
# http://www.st.com/spear
#
# List of board modifications to enable SRST, as reported in
# ST Application Note (FIXME: add reference).
# - Modifications on the top layer:
#    1. replace reset chip U4 with a STM6315SDW13F;
# - Modifications on the bottom layer:
#    2. add 0 ohm resistor R10. It is located close to JTAG connector.
#    3. add a 10K ohm pull-up resistor on the reset wire named as
#       POWERGOOD in the schematic.
#
# The easier way to do modification 3, is to use a resistor in package
# 0603 and solder it between R10 and R54:
# - one pad soldered with the pad of R54 connected to 3.3V (this
#   is the pad of R54 far from JTAG connector J4)
# - the other pad soldered with the nearest pad of R10.
