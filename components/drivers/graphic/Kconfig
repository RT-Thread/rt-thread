      Enable the RT-Thread LCD/graphics driver framework so display controllers
      can expose framebuffers or panel pipelines. This pulls in the drawing
      helpers used by GUI packages; select it whenever your board has an LCD or
      RGB/MIPI panel. Disable it on headless builds to save code size.
