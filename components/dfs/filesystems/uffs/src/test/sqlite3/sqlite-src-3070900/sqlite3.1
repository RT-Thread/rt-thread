.SH NAME
.B sqlite3 
\- A command line interface for SQLite version 3

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sqlite3
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ databasefile ]
.RI [ SQL ]

.SH SUMMARY
.PP
.B sqlite3
is a terminal-based front-end to the SQLite library that can evaluate
queries interactively and display the results in multiple formats.
.B sqlite3
can also be used within shell scripts and other applications to provide
batch processing features.

.SH DESCRIPTION
To start a
.B sqlite3
interactive session, invoke the
.B sqlite3
command and optionally provide the name of a database file.  If the
database file does not exist, it will be created.  If the database file
does exist, it will be opened.

For example, to create a new database file named "mydata.db", create
a table named "memos" and insert a couple of records into that table:
.sp
$ 
.B sqlite3 mydata.db
.br
SQLite version 3.1.3
.br
Enter ".help" for instructions
.br
sqlite>
.B create table memos(text, priority INTEGER);
.br
sqlite>
.B insert into memos values('deliver project description', 10);
.br
sqlite>
.B insert into memos values('lunch with Christine', 100);
.br
sqlite>
.B select * from memos;
.br
deliver project description|10
.br
lunch with Christine|100
.br
sqlite>
.sp

If no database name is supplied, the ATTACH sql command can be used
to attach to existing or create new database files.  ATTACH can also
be used to attach to multiple databases within the same interactive
session.  This is useful for migrating data between databases,
possibly changing the schema along the way.

Optionally, a SQL statement or set of SQL statements can be supplied as
a single argument.  Multiple statements should be separated by
semi-colons.

For example:
.sp
$ 
.B sqlite3 -line mydata.db 'select * from memos where priority > 20;'
.br
    text = lunch with Christine
.br
priority = 100
.br
.sp

.SS SQLITE META-COMMANDS
.PP
The interactive interpreter offers a set of meta-commands that can be
used to control the output format, examine the currently attached
database files, or perform administrative operations upon the
attached databases (such as rebuilding indices).   Meta-commands are
always prefixed with a dot (.).

A list of available meta-commands can be viewed at any time by issuing
the '.help' command.  For example:
.sp
sqlite>
.B .help
.nf
.cc |

.SH OPTIONS
.B sqlite3
has the following options:
.TP
.BI \-init\ file

.I file
, which can contain a mix of SQL statements and meta-commands.
.TP
.B \-echo
Print commands before execution.
.TP
.B \-[no]header
Turn headers on or off.
.TP
.B \-column
Query results will be displayed in a table like form, using
whitespace characters to separate the columns and align the
output.
.TP
.B \-html
Query results will be output as simple HTML tables.
.TP
.B \-line
Query results will be displayed with one value per line, rows
separated by a blank line.  Designed to be easily parsed by
scripts or other programs
.TP
.B \-list
Query results will be displayed with the separator (|, by default)
character between each field value.  The default.
.TP
.BI \-separator\  separator
Set output field separator.  Default is '|'.
.TP

Set string used to represent NULL values.  Default is ''
(empty string).
.TP
.B \-version

.SH INIT FILE
.B sqlite3
reads an initialization file to set the configuration of the
interactive environment.  Throughout initialization, any previously
specified setting can be overridden.  The sequence of initialization is
as follows:

o The default configuration is established as follows:

.sp
.nf
.cc |
mode            = LIST
separator       = "|"
main prompt     = "sqlite> "
continue prompt = "   ...> "
|cc .
.sp
.fi

o If the file 
.B ~/.sqliterc
exists, it is processed first.
can be found in the user's home directory, it is
read and processed.  It should generally only contain meta-commands.

o If the -init option is present, the specified file is processed.

o All other command line options are processed.
