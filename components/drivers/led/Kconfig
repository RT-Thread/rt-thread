      Enable the LED framework so on-board indicators described in device tree
      can be registered and controlled via `rt_led_set_state()` (on/off/blink).
      The core parses LED nodes, exports sysfs-like control via IPC, and lets
      other subsystems (for example triggers) manipulate them. Disable it when
      the hardware has no controllable LEDs.

      Provide the GPIO-backed LED driver that maps each `leds` device-tree node
      to a pin, honours `default-state`/`default-trigger`, and optionally
      applies pinctrl states per LED. Enable this for the common case where
      LEDs are tied directly to GPIOs; leave disabled if LEDs are driven through
      a different bus (I2C expanders, PMICs, etc.).
