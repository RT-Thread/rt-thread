/**@brief Event encoding dispatcher.
 *
 * The event encoding dispatcher will route the event packet to the correct encoder which in turn
 * encodes the contents of the event and updates the \p p_buf buffer.
 *
 * @param[in] p_event          Pointer to the \ref ant_evt_t buffer that shall be encoded.
 * @param[in] event_len        Size (in bytes) of \p p_event buffer.
 * @param[out] p_buf           Pointer to the beginning of a buffer for encoded event packet.
 * @param[in,out] p_buf_len    \c in: Size (in bytes) of \p p_buf buffer.
 *                             \c out: Length of encoded contents in \p p_buf.
 *
 * @retval NRF_SUCCESS               Encoding success.
 * @retval NRF_ERROR_NULL            Encoding failure. NULL pointer supplied.
 * @retval NRF_ERROR_INVALID_LENGTH  Encoding failure. Incorrect buffer length.
 * @retval NRF_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED   Event encoder is not implemented.
