INTRODUCTION
------------

UFFS is a nand flash file system designed for embedded system.

UFFS have some unique and advanced features:
  * Low cost: e.g. it needs only 41K bytes RAM for 64MB NAND flash (page size 2048).
    
  * Fast booting: it reads only a few spares from each block, typically
    mounting a fully filled file system (Gbits) within one second.
    
  * Superb Reliability: 
    - The file system is designed for the embedded system which may 
        frequently lost power/reset without care.
    - Journal file system, the file system will automatically rollback
        to the last state when lost power on the middle of flash programing.
    - When 'write' return without error, the data is guarenteed been
        saved on flash.

  * Fast file create/read/write/seek.  
  * Bad-block tolerant, ECC enable and good ware-leveling.
  * There is no garbage collection needed for UFFS.
  * Support multiple NAND flash class in one system.
  * Support bare flash hardware, no operating system needed. 
  * Support static memory allocation (works without 'malloc').
  * Fully simulated on PC (Windows/Linux) platform.

Disadvantage:
  * space inefficency for small files: UFFS use at least one
   'block'(the minial erase unit for NAND flash, e.g. 16K ) for a file.
  * maximum supported blocks: 2^16 = 65535

Memory consuming example:
    For page size = 512:
        [VARY]Tree nodes: 16 * total_blocks 
        [CONST]Page Bufs: MAX_CACHED_BUFFERS(10) * (40 + pageSize(512)) = 5.4K 
        [CONST]Block Info caches: (24 + 14 * pages_per_block (32)) * MAX_CACHED_BLOCK_INFO (10) = 4.6K

        Example 1: 128M bytes NAND, 8192 blocks, total memory cost:
            (16 * 8192)128K + 5.4K + 4.6K = 138K bytes.
		
        Example 2: 32M Bytes NAND, 2048 blocks, total memory cost:
            (16 * 2048)32K + 5.4K + 4.6K = 42K bytes.
		
        Example 3: 16M bytes NAND, 1024 blocks, total memory cost:
            (16 * 1024)16K + 5.4K + 4.6K = 26K bytes.

    For page size = 2048:
        [VARY]Tree nodes: 16 * total_blocks 
        [CONST]Page Bufs: MAX_CACHED_BUFFERS(10) * (40 + pageSize(2048)) = 20.4K 
        [CONST]Block Info caches: (24 + 14 * pages_per_block (32)) * MAX_CACHED_BLOCK_INFO (10) = 4.6K

        Example 1: 512M bytes NAND, 8192 blocks, total memory cost:
            (16 * 8192)128K + 20.4K + 4.6K = 153K bytes.
		
        Example 2: 128M Bytes NAND, 2048 blocks, total memory cost:
            (16 * 2048)32K + 20.4K + 4.6K = 57K bytes.
		
        Example 3: 64M bytes NAND, 1024 blocks, total memory cost:
            (16 * 1024)16K + 20.4K + 4.6K = 41K bytes.
            

BUILD SIMULATOR REQUIREMENT
---------------------------
From V1.2.0, build uffs simulator requires 'cmake'.
'cmake' can be downloaded from: http://www.cmake.org/

or, under Debian/Ubuntu:
  sudo apt-get install cmake

BUILD SIMULATOR ON LINUX
------------------------
1) create a 'build' dir:

mkdir -p ~/build/uffs

2) create Makefiles and build:
  cd ~/build/uffs
  cmake <path_to_uffs>
  make

5) run simulator (interactive mode):
  src/utils/mkuffs
 
 
BUILD SIMULATOR ON WINDOWS
--------------------------

1) create a 'build' dir along with uffs source dir,
 d:\build\uffs

2) Create VC project files:
  cd build\uffs
  cmake <path_to_uffs>

3) Open uffs.dsw (or uffs.sln for VC > 6 ), compile & run.

 
LATEST SOURCE CODE
------------------
You can get the latest source code from git repository:
  git clone git://uffs.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/uffs/uffs

TESTING UFFS WITH SQLITE3 REGRESSION TEST CASES
-----------------------------------------------
UFFS can be tested with sqlite3 regression test cases (on Linux).

1) install tcl8.5-dev on host PC:
	apt-get install tcl8.5 tcl8.5-dev

    # make sure your Linux is using tcl8.5 as the default tclsh:
		sudo update-alternatives --config tclsh
		(select "tclsh8.5" from the list.)

2) build uffs:
	mkdir -p ~/build/uffs
	cd ~/build/uffs
	cmake <path_to_uffs>

3) build sqlite3:
	cd <path_to_uffs>/src/test/sqlite3/sqlite-src-3070900
	./configure        					 # create some build support files
	git checkout -f Makefile config.h    # restore modified Makefile and config.h
	make test                            # start build 'testfixture' program.
	
	# now you'll see something like:
	Connect: Connection refused
	Assert (uffs_ret == ret && ret == bak_ret) fail at /home/.../src/test/api_test/os_uffs.c:os_unlink:329: unlink("/home/.../src/test/sqlite3/sqlite-src-3070900/./test.db-journal"), unix return 0, uffs return -1, bak return -1
	make: *** [test] Error 1

4) run test cases:
	Open two terminals.
	on termional A:
		cd ~/build/uffs
		src/utils/mkuffs -t 1024

		#on uffs simulator command line, enter:
		format /
		apisrv

	on terminal B:
		cd <path_to_uffs>/src/test/sqlite3/sqlite-src-3070900
		./test-uffs.sh

	Note: if you want to run mkuffs on another PC, for example, a Windows PC, you need to specify the IP address in test-uffs.sh.
	
	The test will take 1~4 hours, depends on how fast your Linux box is.
