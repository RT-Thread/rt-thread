      Turn on the reset-controller framework that lets platform drivers acquire
      reset lines by phandle, assert/deassert them, and request pulse sequences.
      This mirrors the Linux-style reset subsystem and requires both the device
      model and flattened device tree parser because controllers and consumers
      are linked by DT properties. Enable it whenever your SoC has shareable
      reset gates (RCC, PRCM, etc.) described in DTS; otherwise peripheral
      drivers such as DMA or watchdog blocks cannot safely leave reset.

      Build the generic MMIO reset controller that toggles bits inside one or
      more memory-mapped registers. The driver supports active-high/-low lines,
      exposes optional delay-based `reset()` callbacks, and covers many SoC
      reset managers listed in its compatible table (STM32 RCC, Allwinner,
      Synopsys DW, Sophgo SG2042, etc.). Select this when your DTS describes
      a `reset-simple`-compatible node or when downstream controllers reuse the
      same register layout; leave it disabled if you rely on a custom reset IP.
