Hello everyone! I am working on implementing a tool to assess the complexity of CPU architecture porting. It primarily focuses on RISC-V architecture porting. As part of my dataset, I have collected the rt-thread project. By using scanning tools, I have determined that the porting complexity is high due to a significant amount of code related to the CPU architecture. It would require a professional team to handle this task. Is this assessment accurate? I look forward to your help and response.
