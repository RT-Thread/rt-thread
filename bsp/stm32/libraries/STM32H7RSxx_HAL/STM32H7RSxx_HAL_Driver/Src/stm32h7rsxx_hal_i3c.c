                                           ##### How to use this driver #####
  ======================================================================================================================
    [..]
    The I3C HAL driver can be used as follows:

    (#) Declare a I3C_HandleTypeDef handle structure, for example:
        I3C_HandleTypeDef  hi3c;

    (#) Declare a I3C_XferTypeDef transfer descriptor structure, for example:
        I3C_XferTypeDef  ContextBuffers;

    (#)Initialize the I3C low level resources by implementing the HAL_I3C_MspInit() API:
        (##) Enable the I3Cx interface clock
        (##) I3C pins configuration
            (+++) Enable the clock for the I3C GPIOs
            (+++) Configure I3C pins as alternate function push-pull with no-pull
        (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process
            (+++) Configure the I3Cx interrupt priority
            (+++) Enable the NVIC I3C IRQ Channel
        (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process
            (+++) Declare a DMA_HandleTypeDef handle structure for
                  the Command Common Code (CCC) management channel
            (+++) Declare a DMA_HandleTypeDef handle structure for
                  the transmit channel
            (+++) Declare a DMA_HandleTypeDef handle structure for
                  the receive channel
            (+++) Declare a DMA_HandleTypeDef handle structure for
                  the status channel
            (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock
            (+++) Configure the DMA handle parameters
            (+++) Configure the DMA Command Common Code (CCC) channel
            (+++) Configure the DMA Tx channel
            (+++) Configure the DMA Rx channel
            (+++) Configure the DMA Status channel
            (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the hi3c DMA CCC, Tx, Rx or Status handle as necessary
            (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on
                  the DMA CCC, Tx, Rx or Status instance

    (#) Configure the HAL I3C Communication Mode as Controller or Target in the hi3c Init structure.

    (#) Configure the Controller Communication Bus characterics for Controller mode.
        This mean, configure the parameters SDAHoldTime, WaitTime, SCLPPLowDuration,
        SCLI3CHighDuration, SCLODLowDuration, SCLI2CHighDuration, BusFreeDuration,
        BusIdleDuration in the LL_I3C_CtrlBusConfTypeDef structure through h3c Init structure.

    (#) Configure the Target Communication Bus characterics for Target mode.
        This mean, configure the parameter BusAvailableDuration in the LL_I3C_TgtBusConfTypeDef structure
        through h3c Init structure.

        All these parameters for Controller or Target can be configured directly in user code or
        by using CubeMx generation.
        To help the computation of the different parameters, the recommendation is to use CubeMx.

        Those parameters can be modified after the hi3c initialization by using
        HAL_I3C_Ctrl_BusCharacteristicConfig() for controller and
        HAL_I3C_Tgt_BusCharacteristicConfig() for target.

    (#) Initialize the I3C registers by calling the HAL_I3C_Init(), configures also the low level Hardware
        (GPIO, CLOCK, NVIC...etc) by calling the customized HAL_I3C_MspInit(&hi3c) API.

    (#) Configure the different FIFO parameters in I3C_FifoConfTypeDef structure as RxFifoThreshold, TxFifoThreshold
        for Controller or Target mode.
        And enable/disable the Control or Status FIFO only for Controller Mode.
        Use HAL_I3C_SetConfigFifo() function to finalize the configuration, and HAL_I3C_GetConfigFifo() to retrieve
        FIFO configuration.
        Possibility to clear the FIFO configuration by using HAL_I3C_ClearConfigFifo() which reset the configuration
        FIFO to their default hardware value

    (#) Configure the different additional Controller configuration in I3C_CtrlConfTypeDef structure as DynamicAddr,
        StallTime, HotJoinAllowed, ACKStallState, CCCStallState, TxStallState, RxStallState, HighKeeperSDA.
        Use HAL_I3C_Ctrl_Config() function to finalize the Controller configuration.

    (#) Configure the different additional Target configuration in I3C_TgtConfTypeDef structure as Identifier,
        MIPIIdentifier, CtrlRoleRequest, HotJoinRequest, IBIRequest, IBIPayload, IBIPayloadSize, MaxReadDataSize,
        MaxWriteDataSize, CtrlCapability, GroupAddrCapability, DataTurnAroundDuration, MaxReadTurnAround,
        MaxDataSpeed, MaxSpeedLimitation, HandOffActivityState, HandOffDelay, PendingReadMDB.
        Use HAL_I3C_Tgt_Config() function to finalize the Target configuration.

    (#) Before initiate any IO operation, the application must launch an assignment of the different
        Target dynamic address by using HAL_I3C_Ctrl_DynAddrAssign() in polling mode or
        HAL_I3C_Ctrl_DynAddrAssign_IT() in interrupt mode.
        This procedure is named Enter Dynamic Address Assignment (ENTDAA CCC command).
        For the initiation of ENTDAA procedure from the controller, each target connected and powered on the I3C bus
        must repond to this particular Command Common Code by sending its proper Payload (a amount of 48bits which
        contain the target characteristics)
        Each time a target responds to ENTDAA sequence, the application is informed through
        HAL_I3C_TgtReqDynamicAddrCallback() of the reception of the target paylaod.
        And then application must send a associated dynamic address through HAL_I3C_Ctrl_SetDynAddr().
        This procedure in loop automatically in hardware side until a target respond to repeated ENTDAA sequence.
        The application is informed of the end of the procedure at reception of HAL_I3C_CtrlDAACpltCallback().
        Then application can easily retrieve ENTDAA payload information through HAL_I3C_Get_ENTDAA_Payload_Info()
        function.
        At the end of procedure, the function HAL_I3C_Ctrl_ConfigBusDevices() must be called to store in hardware
        register part the target capabilities as Dynamic address, IBI support with or without additional data byte,
        Controller role request support, Controller stop transfer after IBI through I3C_DeviceConfTypeDef structure.

    (#) Other action to be done, before initiate any IO operation, the application must prepare the different frame
        descriptor with its associated buffer allocation in their side.
        Configure the different information related to CCC transfer through I3C_CCCTypeDef structure
        Configure the different information related to Private or I2C transfer through I3C_PrivateTypeDef structure
        Configure the different buffer pointers and associated size needed for the driver communication
        through I3C_XferTypeDef structure
        The I3C_XferTypeDef structure contains different parameters about Control, Status buffer,
        and Transmit and Receive buffer.
        Use HAL_I3C_AddDescToFrame() function each time application add a descriptor in the frame before call
        an IO operation interface
        One element of the frame descriptor correspond to one frame to manage through IO operation.

    (#) To check if I3C target device is ready for communication, use the function HAL_I3C_Ctrl_IsDeviceI3C_Ready()

    (#) To check if I2C target device is ready for communication, use the function HAL_I3C_Ctrl_IsDeviceI2C_Ready()

    (#) For I3C IO operations, three operation modes are available within this driver :

     *** I3C HAL driver macros list ***
     ==================================
     [..]
       Below the list of most used macros in I3C HAL driver.

      (+) __HAL_I3C_ENABLE: Enable the I3C peripheral
      (+) __HAL_I3C_DISABLE: Disable the I3C peripheral
      (+) __HAL_I3C_RESET_HANDLE_STATE: Reset the I3C handle state
      (+) __HAL_I3C_GET_FLAG: Check whether the specified I3C flag is set or not

     *** Callback registration ***
     =============================================
    [..]
     The compilation flag USE_HAL_I3C_REGISTER_CALLBACKS when set to 1
     allows the user to configure dynamically the driver callbacks.
     Use Functions HAL_I3C_RegisterCallback() or HAL_I3C_RegisterNotifyCallback()
     or HAL_I3C_RegisterTgtReqDynamicAddrCallback() or HAL_I3C_RegisterTgtHotJoinCallback()
     to register an interrupt callback.
    [..]
     Function HAL_I3C_RegisterCallback() allows to register following callbacks:
       (+) CtrlTxCpltCallback   : callback for Controller transmission CCC, I3C private or I2C end of transfer.
       (+) CtrlRxCpltCallback   : callback for Controller reception CCC, I3C private or I2C end of transfer.
       (+) CtrlMultipleXferCpltCallback : callback for Controller multiple Direct CCC, I3C private or I2C
           end of transfer.
       (+) CtrlDAACpltCallback  : callback for Controller Enter Dynamic Address Assignment end of transfer.
       (+) TgtTxCpltCallback    : callback for Target transmission I3C private end of transfer.
       (+) TgtRxCpltCallback    : callback for Target reception I3C private end of transfer.
       (+) ErrorCallback        : callback for error detection.
       (+) AbortCpltCallback    : callback for abort completion process.
       (+) MspInitCallback      : callback for Msp Init.
       (+) MspDeInitCallback    : callback for Msp DeInit.
     This function takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle, the Callback ID
     and a pointer to the user callback function.
    [..]
     For specific callback NotifyCallback
     use dedicated register callbacks : HAL_I3C_RegisterNotifyCallback().
    [..]
     For specific callback TgtReqDynamicAddrCallback
     use dedicated register callbacks : HAL_I3C_RegisterTgtReqDynamicAddrCallback().
    [..]
     For specific callback TgtHotJoinCallback
     use dedicated register callbacks : HAL_I3C_RegisterTgtHotJoinCallback().
    [..]
     Use function HAL_I3C_UnRegisterCallback to reset a callback to the default
     weak function.
     HAL_I3C_UnRegisterCallback takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle,
     and the Callback ID.
     This function allows to reset following callbacks:
       (+) CtrlTxCpltCallback   : callback for Controller transmission CCC, I3C private or I2C end of transfer.
       (+) CtrlRxCpltCallback   : callback for Controller reception CCC, I3C private or I2C end of transfer.
       (+) CtrlMultipleXferCpltCallback : callback for Controller multiple Direct CCC, I3C private or I2C
           end of transfer.
       (+) CtrlDAACpltCallback  : callback for Controller Enter Dynamic Address Assignment end of transfer.
       (+) TgtTxCpltCallback    : callback for Target transmission I3C private end of transfer.
       (+) TgtRxCpltCallback    : callback for Target reception I3C private end of transfer.
       (+) ErrorCallback        : callback for error detection.
       (+) AbortCpltCallback    : callback for abort completion process.
       (+) MspInitCallback      : callback for Msp Init.
       (+) MspDeInitCallback    : callback for Msp DeInit.
       (+) NotifyCallback       : callback for Controller and Target notification process.
       (+) TgtReqDynamicAddrCallback  : callback for controller application
            when a target sent its payload to the controller during Dynamic Address Assignment process.
       (+) TgtHotJoinCallback   : callback for Target Hotjoin completion process.
    [..]
     By default, after the HAL_I3C_Init() and when the state is HAL_I3C_STATE_RESET
     all callbacks are set to the corresponding weak functions:
     examples HAL_I3C_CtrlTxCpltCallback(), HAL_I3C_CtrlRxCpltCallback().
     Exception done for MspInit and MspDeInit functions that are
     reset to the legacy weak functions in the HAL_I3C_Init()/ HAL_I3C_DeInit() only when
     these callbacks are null (not registered beforehand).
     If MspInit or MspDeInit are not null, the HAL_I3C_Init()/ HAL_I3C_DeInit()
     keep and use the user MspInit/MspDeInit callbacks (registered beforehand) whatever the state.
    [..]
     Callbacks can be registered/unregistered in HAL_I3C_STATE_READY state only.
     Exception done MspInit/MspDeInit functions that can be registered/unregistered
     in HAL_I3C_STATE_READY or HAL_I3C_STATE_RESET state,
     thus registered (user) MspInit/DeInit callbacks can be used during the Init/DeInit.
     Then, the user first registers the MspInit/MspDeInit user callbacks
     using HAL_I3C_RegisterCallback() before calling HAL_I3C_DeInit()
     or HAL_I3C_Init() function.
    [..]
     When the compilation flag USE_HAL_I3C_REGISTER_CALLBACKS is set to 0 or
     not defined, the callback registration feature is not available and all callbacks
     are set to the corresponding weak functions.

         (+) Call the function HAL_I3C_Init() to configure the bus characteristic depends on the device mode
             with the selected configuration below:

             (++) Controller mode, Serial source clock wave form configuration:
                  (+++) SCL push pull low duration
                  (+++) SCL I3C high duration
                  (+++) SCL open drain low duration
                  (+++) SCL I2C high duration

             (++) Controller mode, Bus timing configuration:

                                    ##### Interrupt and callback functions #####
 =======================================================================================================================
    [..]  This subsection provides a set of functions allowing to manage callbacks and interrupts request:

         (+) Register/Unregister callback function:
             (++) Call the function HAL_I3C_RegisterCallback() to register an I3C user callback.
             (++) Call the function HAL_I3C_RegisterNotifyCallback() to register an I3C user notification callback.
             (++) Call the function HAL_I3C_RegisterDynamicAddrCallback() to register an I3C user address callback.
             (++) Call the function HAL_I3C_RegisterHotJoinCallback() to register an I3C user hot join callback.
             (++) Call the function HAL_I3C_UnRegisterCallback() to unregister an I3C user callback.

         (+) Notification management function:
             (++) Call the function HAL_I3C_ActivateNotification() to activate the I3C notifications.
             (++) Call the function HAL_I3C_DeactivateNotification() to deactivate the I3C notifications.

         (+) Controller callback functions:
             (++) Users must implement HAL_I3C_CtrlTxCpltCallback() function when the transmission of private data or
                  Tx CCC transfer is completed.
             (++) Users must implement HAL_I3C_CtrlRxCpltCallback() function when the reception of private data or
                  Rx CCC transfer is completed.
             (++) Users must implement HAL_I3C_CtrlMultipleXferCpltCallback() function when the multiple
                  transfer of CCC, I3C private or I2C transfer is completed.
             (++) Users must implement HAL_I3C_CtrlDAACpltCallback() function when Dynamic Address Assignment
                  procedure is completed.
             (++) Users must implement HAL_I3C_TgtReqDynamicAddrCallback() function in the controller application
                  when a target sent its payload to the controller during Dynamic Address Assignment procedure.

         (+) Target callback functions:
             (++) Users must implement HAL_I3C_TgtTxCpltCallback() function when the transmission of private
                  data is completed.
             (++) Users must implement HAL_I3C_TgtRxCpltCallback() function when the reception of private
                  data is completed.
             (++) Users must implement HAL_I3C_TgtHotJoinCallback() function when a target hot join process
                  is completed.

         (+) Common callback functions:
             (++) Users must implement HAL_I3C_NotifyCallback() function when the device receives
                  an asynchronous event like IBI, a Hot-join, CCC command for target...
             (++) Users must implement HAL_I3C_AbortCpltCallback() function when an abort process is completed.
             (++) Users must implement HAL_I3C_ErrorCallback() function when an error is occurred.

         (+) Interrupt and event function:
             (++) Call the function HAL_I3C_ER_IRQHandler() in the ISR file to handle I3C error interrupts request.
             (++) Call the function HAL_I3C_EV_IRQHandler() in the ISR file to handle I3C event interrupts request.
