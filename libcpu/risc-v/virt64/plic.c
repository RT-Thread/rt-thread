 * Priority 1 is the lowest active priority, and priority 7 is the highest.
 * Ties between global interrupts of the same priority are broken by
 * the Interrupt ID; interrupts with the lowest ID have the highest

 * DESCRIPTION:
 *    Writing the interrupt ID it received from the claim (irq) to the

 *    The PLIC does not check whether the completion ID is the same as the
 *    last claim ID for that target. If the completion ID does not match an
 *    interrupt source that is currently enabled for the target, the completion
 *    is silently ignored.
