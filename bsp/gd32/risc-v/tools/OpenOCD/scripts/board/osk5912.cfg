# NOTE: this assumes you're using the ARM 20-pin ("Multi-ICE")
# JTAG connector, and accordingly have J1 connecting pins 1 & 2.
# The TI-14 pin needs "trst_only", and J1 connecting 2 & 3.
reset_config trst_and_srst separate

# NOTE:  boards with XOMAP parts wire nSRST to nPWRON_RESET.
# That resets everything -- including JTAG and EmbeddedICE.
# So they must use "reset_config srst_pulls_trst".

# NOTE:  an expansion board could add a trace connector ... if
# it does, change this appropriately.  And reset_config too,
# assuming JTAG_DIS reroutes JTAG to that connector.
