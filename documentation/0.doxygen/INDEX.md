@page page_howto_doxygen How to write doxygen documentation for RT-Thread

RT-Thread Online Documentation is created based on doxygen and is available at: <https://rt-thread.github.io/rt-thread/>. It is consisted of two parts.

One part is the detailed introduction of Kernel, which is written in markdown format and converted into HTML page by doxygen. It is displayed under "RT-Thread User Guide" in Treeview on the left side of the browser. Each sub-chapter is organized into a hierarchical structure by using doxygen's [subpage mechanism][2]. To define a page, we use `@page` command. The page name should be prefixed with a "page_", and the page name should be unique. Besides this, there are no special requirements for writing this part, so I will not go into details in this article.

The other part is the description of API. RT-Thread uses [doxygen][1] to automate the generation of documentation from source code comments, parsing information about classes, functions, and variables to produce output in format of HTML. It is displayed under "Modules" in Treeview on the left side of the browser. Each sub-chapter is organized into a hierarchical structure by using doxygen's [topics mechanism][3]. The main content of this article is to describe how to write API with doxygen.

# General Rules on writing API documentation

@note The code comments and HTML content generated by doxygen in this guide, for the **structures**, **constants(macro definition)**, **enumeration values**, **union values**, **global functions**, **global variables** and other objects involved are all within the scope of the **RT-Thread kernel API**. The code of internal functions, variables (such as static functions etc.) are not belong to the API scope, how to write comment for these elements are not considered in this guide.

By default, API documentation is written in header files, but there are exceptions, such as for **functions**.

There are several ways to mark a comment block as a detailed description. We prefer JavaDoc-style (C-style) comment block with some additional markings to document the code, like this:

```
/**
 * ... text ...
 */
```

When you want to put documentation after members, we prefer a Qt style, like this:

```
int var; /**< Detailed description after the member */
```

When writing comments based on doxygen, several commands defined by doxygen are used. See <https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html> for more details about doxygen commands.

More details refer to [Doxygen Docs: Documenting the code][4]

# Build & Run

## How to build & run doxygen html on Ubuntu

The following steps are verified on Ubuntu 22.04：

```shell
$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
Release:	22.04
Codename:	jammy
```

The following packages (and dependents) need to be installed:

```shell
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install doxygen
$ sudo apt install graphviz
```

Assume that the path of RT-Thead code tree is $RTT, execute the following command to build html.

```shell
$ cd $RTT/documentation
$ rm -rf html
$ doxygen
```

A new html directory will be created and all the html files will be placed in this directory.

If you want to quickly browse HTML locally (in Ubuntu environment), you can enter the html directory and start a local HTML server through Python.

```shell
$ cd html
$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

A bash script `run.sh` is provided to automatic upon operations.

```shell
$ cd $RTT/documentation
$ ./run.sh
```

Then open the browser and enter `http://<IP>:8000/index.html` to access the created html web pages. If it is a local access, then `<IP>` should be replaced by `localhost`. If it is a remote access, then `<IP>` should be replaced by the actual accessible IP address of the machine where HTML is located.

## How to build & run doxygen html with Doxywizard

1. download from https://doxygen.nl/index.html
2. open `Doxywizard`
3. `File` -> `Open`
4. Open the file ./Doxyfile 
5.  To tab `Run` , Click `Run doxygen`
