# PSoC 6 GNU make Build System

## Overview

This repo provides the build recipe make files and scripts for building and programming PSoC 6 applications. Builds can be run either through a command-line interface (CLI) or through the ModusToolbox Integrated Devlopment Environment (IDE).

## Prerequisite

Builds require that the ModusToolbox tools be installed on your machine. This comes with the ModusToolbox IDE install. On Windows machines, it is recommended that CLI builds be executed using the Cygwin.bat located in ModusToolBox/tools_x.y/modus-shell install directory. This guarantees a consistent shell environment for your builds.

## Options

To list the build options, run the "help" target by typing "make help" in CLI. For a verbose documentation on a specific subject type "make help CY_HELP={variable/target}", where "variable" or "target" is one of the listed make variables or targets.
