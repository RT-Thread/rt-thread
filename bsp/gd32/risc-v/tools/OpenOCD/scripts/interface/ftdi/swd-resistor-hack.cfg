#
# Connect TDI to SWDIO via a suitable series resistor (220-470 Ohm or
# so depending on the drive capability of the target and adapter);
# connect TDO directly to SWDIO.
#
# You also need to have reliable GND connection between the target and
# adapter. Vref of the adapter should be supplied with a voltage equal
# to the target's (preferrably connect it to Vcc). You can also
# optionally connect nSRST. Leave everything else unconnected.
