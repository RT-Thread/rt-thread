# List of maintainers of the RT-Thread open-source community
#
# This file manages the maintainers and their associated sections in the repository.
# Developers should update this file according to project needs.
# The following are explanations of each field and guidelines for adding new maintainer entries.
#
# When adding new entries, please follow the format:
#
# 1. **tag** - Assign a unique tag to each entry for identifying the code module or functionality.
#    - The tag should be concise and descriptive, such as `workflow`, `libc`...
#    - **Rule for Adding**: Use a new tag when adding a new functionality or module to ensure it clearly describes the area of responsibility.
#
# 2. **path** - Specify the directory or file path that the maintainer is responsible for.
#    - The path must be relative to the repository's root directory and can refer to either a single file or a folder.
#    - If the maintainer is responsible for all files in a directory, use the directory path; if it's for a specific file, provide the full file path.
#    - **Rule for Adding**: Ensure that the path correctly points to the relevant code location. Please note that a tag should correspond to only one path. Currently, multiple paths are not supported.
#
# 3. **owners** - List the maintainers responsible for the section, including their GitHub usernames and contact information.
#    - The owners should be listed as a comma-separated list if there are multiple maintainers.
#    - Format: `Name(GitHub username)<email address>`.
#    - **Rule for Adding**: Ensure that the listed GitHub usernames are correct, and the maintainers are aware of their responsibilities and duties.
#
# Example: How to Add a Maintainer Entry
#
# The following is a template for adding new entries in the MAINTAINER file:
#
# tag: <module-name>
# path: <file-or-directory-path>
# owners: <maintainer1>, <maintainer2>, ...
#
# When adding entries, please follow these guidelines:
# - Ensure the `tag` is unique and descriptive.
# - Ensure the `path` points to the correct location in the repository.
# - Ensure the `owners` are accurate and that all new maintainers are aware of their responsibilities.
#
# Example Entry:
# tag: example-module
# path: example/module/path
# owners: John Doe(johndoe)<johndoe@example.com>, Jane Smith(janesmith)<janesmith@example.com>

# Note: 
# - Each entry includes a `tag` that identifies the module or functionality, a `path` that points to the relevant code location, and `owners` who are the maintainers for that part of the codebase.
# - If there are multiple entries, each entry should be separated by a blank line. Within a single entry, there is no need to insert blank lines between the tag, path, and owners.
# - Each entry must be sorted in alphabetical order with tag as the keyword.
