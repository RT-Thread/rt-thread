# NXP FRDM-MCXC444 Introduction

## Overview
The FRDM-MCXC444 is NXP's official low-cost evaluation board based on the MCX C444 MCU. It is designed for rapid prototyping and features a compact and scalable form factor. The board provides industry-standard headers for easy access to the MCU's I/O pins and supports the MCUXpresso development environment. 

Key features of the FRDM-MCXC444 include:

- SLCD functionality
- Arduino-compatible expansion headers
- MCUXpresso IDE support

The appearance of the board is shown in the figure below:

## Preparation

To run sample programs on the FRDM-MCXC444 board, you need to make the following preparations:

1. Development Environment

   Keil V5 with MCXC444 package installed.

2. Source Code Acquisition

   Visit https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread and download the latest stable release zip package from the Assets section.

3. Hardware Connection

   Use a USB cable to connect the USB port of the development board to your PC.

## Run the First Sample Program

### Compile and Download

1. Navigate to the `rt-thread\bsp\nxp\mcxc\frdm-mcxc444` folder.
2. Open the project file in Keil.
3. Compile the project.
4. Click the download button to flash the firmware to the development board.

After downloading the program, it should start running automatically. If not, press the reset button on the board.

Connect the board's serial port to your PC and open a serial terminal with the following settings:

- Baud rate: 115200
- Data bits: 8
- Stop bits: 1
- Parity: None

Reset the device, and you should see the RT-Thread startup information in the serial terminal:
