/**
 * @defgroup group_signal Signal
 * @brief signal is used for thread kill etc.
 *
 * A signal (also known as a soft interrupt signal), from a software perspective,
 * is a simulation of interrupt mechanism. When it comes to its principle,
 * thread receiving a signal is similar to processor receiving an interrupt request.
